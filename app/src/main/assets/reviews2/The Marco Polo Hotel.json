The hotel feels like a local target and is not connected to any good shopping or dinning outside the hotel. The pool and facilities are excellent (although why not fix the fountains?) and the breakfast buffet is world class, but the rooms are just average at best. "

Room service is way over priced, but the breakfast buffet is worth the stay itself, with a world class buffet. Pool and recreation areas are nice and clean, but the rooms are carpeted (mine was wet when we arrived) and bathrooms dated... at best average rooms. Security is very heavy, but not effective when I found a hotel daily report in my newspaper that had VIP lists and their rooms, as well as hotel room 'issues' among other things... Hotel is in a part of old Davao at its heart, but not a hotel with any good walking areas nearby... unless one is with locals and likes street food. "

The room is old. The curtains have holes. The curtains are not blacked-out so it's hard to sleep, with lights coming in. Too many small lights inside the room also: from the TV, cable, fire alarm and internet. It's difficult to mix the hot and cold water at the sink. Didn't see any bidet. No free newspaper, No welcome fruit, being in the land of fruits. Security is very intimidating. Stricter than the airport! No interesting places around it. Not even Aldivicno is good for shopping anymore. No, I will not book at this hotel again."

Lastly, the food was not that good. We ate on their restaurant near the pool side and breakfast buffet. But to be fair with them, the staff were superb. "

The final straw was my wife's last visit, when she was refused breakfast if she did not pay, even though the booking clearly stated breakfast was included. She complained but was basically brushed off. On checking out, she complained and the staff said she should have had breakfast but offered no kind of discount or refund. I advise anyone going to Davao to avoid Marco Polo and go to Bondi & Bourke, which is a much nicer hotel and the breakfast is superb."

As we stayed during Valentines Day the normal menu had sadly changed and for 1,500 Php a person the hotel were doing special 5 course set menus. To be honest it didnt look that great and it would have been nice if we could have ordered from the normal menu. Instead we ate at a restaurant outside."

The room was good, beds comfy and the mixed pillows were awesome. With all that said npw for the challenges which made it hard for me to give a 5 star rating... 1. The clothe shower curtains smaller musty which suggests that they are not changed out and washed on a regular basis. 2. The cable service was terrible... the picture kept fuzzing in and out or would completely dissolve to black . Time did not help clear it up. 3 .I encountered 2 different juvenile roaches in the room... I'm not sure if they came in with the room service cart or were pre existing. Either implication should be seriously addressed. 4. Several minor cosmetic repairs needed throughout the property... I'm out of room "

Compared to other security guards we encounter at other hotels and malls, Marco Polo guards follow strict security procedures such as checking the insides of your car and the contents of your suitcase to ensure nothing gets snuck in. The hotel itself is old but has aged well. We found the room comfortable, and the hotel conveniently located around pharmacies, eateries, and banks. The bed wasn't as comfortable as we expected, but it's a minor issue. We'll definitely consider this hotel again for future trips to Davao City."

We have to settle with hard garlic rice, sausage(that tasted spoiled), sunny side up egg and cheeses.. and we are not over reacting coz my husband went and see the food twice to check and still havent refill up yet and its alreadly atleast 40 minutes passed. And addition to this was we were not served water! We're done eating when one of the server saw that we didnt have water and served us straight away.

The Cafe Marco could use a few more staff especially the receptionist who checks people in for breakfast mostly complimentary with our rooms. The lady there gets overwhelmed because not only does she police the guests coming in and out, she also has to check them in, verify their seats, then seat them. The lines to get in can get long and guests can get impatient. I know I was irritated a little because she was getting snappy with me as I was herding my group of 8 cousins in and getting them settled. Otherwise, I like the building still. The front desk service and kitchen service was good. We were there for a private family dinner event and food was satisfactory for the dinner. My family had a lot of fun, and our dinner even turned into karaoke sesh!😅 everybody was happy. Save for 2 more rooms, we had the rest of the entire 5th floor. A security personnel came to check after hours at 10 pm to do routine check."

My room was upgraded to Superior, very spacious and conducive for work, very fast internet. Offers variety of cuisines even at breakfast, delicious and worth it. Visited during Christmas season and it was a plus to see the beautiful decorations which added to the classy ambiance that the hotel brings."

The hotel is conveniently located near the night market and the souvenir shops. So basically we enjoyed our weekend here BUT upon checking out, we were charged with stuff from the minibar. And not only that, when the front desk called to ask the housekeeping if the room was cleared for check out, they said yes. They didn’t mention that my nephew left something. When my nephew realized that he had left something in the room, the housekeeping staff said they didn’t find anything. My dad had to go back to the room and find it himself. And only to find out one of the staff found it. I would have rated this place 5* if the staff were more honest. "

I think this is our 6th stay at this hotel. I just wanted to say that we were somewhat disappointed about the service this time. Our check-in went well, we actually arrived in the afternoon. But we were surprised that our rooms did not have towels. When we raised their attention towards this matter, they said that not all the towels are dry that's why. That should not be the case. Any hotel should have more than enough towel to supply the existing guest and the ones who just checked in."

Then the bathtub is a little tarnished already and may need to be considered for replacement. As for the service, it was topnotch. When I called housekeeping for some request, they promptly delivered the items. The check-in/ check-out process is straightforward as long as the booking is confirmed and correct. The location is also a plus if your purpose in Davao is in the city, as the property is located in a prime spot."

Well maintained building and hats off to their security procedure/system. Remarkable. Our booking is just wrong timing coz the entire pool area is closed till midnight bcoz of a debut party but all OK bcoz we were still able to access Lazuli Spa, one of their signature amenities. Therapists are well trained, accommodating and friendly... facilities & amenities are all well maintained, we even have our own sauna room inside the couples room. Food at \"The Lobby\" is a bit pricey for the quality. Since breakfast buffet is not included with our booking, the front desk officer offered a promo that if we'll avail it upon check in, we can get it for 500/head instead of regular rate of 750/head.. we immediately said \"yes\" and told her to just charge it to our account. Unfortunately, we found out the next morning that only one breakfast was tagged for us, as per the restaurant staff, there are times that their system is malfunctioning in tagging notes/request of the guests. But she was able to fix it and give us discounted rate for 2 heads. They are one of the best breakfast buffets we've tried so far, has a wide selection from appetizer/starters, viands, breads, cheese, drinks, eggs, dessert.. Generally speaking, we enjoyed our stay and will definitely be back again soon :)"

It is a bit dated and in need of a refurbishment but still has character and comfortable. The staff are the best I have encountered anywhere and the owners should be very happy to have such good staff. The only let down is the food. The breakfast is not bad and a large selection but that's as good as it gets. The Bistro and restaurant are in desperate need of an international chef who does not come from the Philippines. I say this because Philippines food is about as bad as it gets. Bland, tasteless, boring slop and it really lets the country down. You will not get a decent meal in Davao, ever, or the Philippines for that matter (although I have not tried Manila yet. But I digress, the hotel is good and I would still recommend it in spite of the terrible food."

I love Lali so much - she knew how I wanted my coffee. Our waiter (sorry forgot his name) was also very very kind, and he knew how we wanted our eggs done. Housekeeping is also great, they provided us with all our needs. The Hotel may not be as New as compared with other Manila hotels, but it made me (and my family) feel at home and well taken cared of. The Duty Manager Arvin is also very very accommodating. He helped me when my key did not work, and provided us with everything we need.

Poor air conditioning system with really old furniture… and the staff at the front desk was really disappointing. It took me so long to check out and I almost missed my flight. It is either they are stupid or they are crooks. They charge against my 3,000 deposit P2,780 but they cannot explain where I spent it. I even have a receipt of my breakfast charges for the kids amounting to 1,500 only. They recomputed over and over again and finally my bill was reduced to 1, 748.17 for the kid’s breakfast. They insisted on this amount and said that the rate in the front desk is different from the rate in their Marco Polo Café. Seriously? How could that be? And besides I showed them my receipt of only P750 pesos per day for 2 days. I don’t have time to argue because I will miss my flight but I have to warn the future guests to check your bill carefully or you will be a victim of their stupidity or scam? And by the way, my hotel package include airport transfer. They pick us up when we arrived at 11:15pm and I was grateful but when I arrange a transport back to the airport at 10pm they said that their transport service is up to 7pm only. So many inconsistencies. What’s wrong with these people? The 2 male Front desk on duty of June 26, 2017 you are a disappointment to Davao. I went there to experience the beautiful things that I heard about Davao and yes I did find it beautiful and peaceful except that it ended in disappointment because of my Marco Polo hotel experience.

Some equipment is 10yrs old. The bike I use never works appropriately. The pool is nice. They also have a sauna which typically works. Some of the rooms have been renovated and others have not. You need to ask for a renovated room. The breakfast is minimal. This hotel almost has a similar lobby set up to Shang but I would call it a D rated shang. Some of the rooms have a pool view which is nice. The room I stayed in was called a cabana room. It was hardly anything like a cabana. But it did have a pool view. "

The standard of food and drinks was so terrific at the Pool bar that we ended up wining and dining only there, apart from our final night in Davao where the four of us dined in the wonderful restaurant on Level 4 overlooking the pool. The staff are fantastic - so wonderfully friendly and very professional. My mother and I love the Marco Polo all round - in addition to the fantastic staff, the delicious food, the reasonably priced wine and the delicious fresh mango daiquiris made by Lawrence and the very comfortable and well appointed bedroom, the location of the hotel is great.

There are some minor improvement for me: (1) Hotel Lobby is filled with Pungent Rose Scent. This triggers allergic reaction for people with fragrance allergy because it is just too strong. I dread and die every time I have to pass by the lobby. (2) Massage at PHP1100 is too expensive for very inexperienced therapists. Please send them to training. It is very disappointing. We are group of 3 people and every single one of us felt the price paid is not worth the service provided. (3) Pool Need to be cleaned more. The water is too foggy and we got itchy coming out of the pool. "

After a complain and even scandal they found us a roon from the same class (premier room) but with city view (noisy). The filter of the aircon maybe was not changed since they installed initially because the roon was smelling very bad. Same evening i got an asthma attack. In the following morning after a new complain the changed the roon but what a surprise: there was no warm water in the shower. Again complain. They sent us a technician. He fixed the water heater. The hotel is pretending to be 5 star luxury hotel but it is very bad maintained, it's not very clean and the bad smell starts even from the lobby. If there is an alternative, better avoid this hotel.

We did get power cuts and back up power was restored right away except once when it took 10 mins , my wife was in the lift with my 1 year old daughter but they got down and i was about to get in when the power cut took place so i was spared 10 mins in a lift , but others were not so lucky , 10 mins is not acceptable and reasons why needs to be looked at , I will stay again as the problems are only minor but need attention "

The pool side dining resto closes its kitchen at 930 pm a full 30 minutes before the advertised closing time of 10PM. They did it every night of our stay. The pool side staff is not good and after some nights I never ate there again. I just ordered from Cafe Marco on the 2nd floor, good food and good staff there. Overall very good hotel and I will return. Very friendly front desk and friendly staff overall."

Horrible experience during breakfast, but probably because it was Valentine's weekend. There were too many people and it was difficult finding a seat for breakfast at Cafe Marco. If you get a club room like I did you have the option of eating your breakfast at the club lounge, but the options will be limited compared to Cafe Marco. Complimentary afternoon tea and evening cocktails was good."

Our bad maybe for not asking but they should be considerate for first-timers like us who don't have enough idea about the hotel. The room was really old, side tables were chipped.
