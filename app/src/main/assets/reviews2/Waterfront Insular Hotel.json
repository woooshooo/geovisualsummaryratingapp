The rooms/bathrooms/Vinta bar are dated and could be udpated and should be upgraded for this price point. Basically everything on the outside of the property is excellent and everything on the inside is and has been in need of a facelift for sometime. I would reccommend the property for a stay in Davao city, however it lacks the newness, cleanliness, and convenience of the Radisson or Seda Abrezza that are similarly priced. If you want a real waterfront location with the ability to swim in the clean sea, then I would highly reccommend the Paradise Island Resort (there is no swimming pool) that is only a five minute boat ride away and a considerably better value.

Couldn't have been more sweet, giving me directions to a function I was attending along with a helpful map, ensuring parking in car park and facilitating an early check in. If nothing else had gone right with hotel this lady ensured I would have left with a good impression. Fortunately everything about the hotel was exceptional, and I don't give praise lightly. It was clean, stylish, roomy with excellent service in both bar where we had lunch and restaurant where we had dinner. Food was beyond good and great value for money and service in both places attentive and efficient. Room itself was well equipped and comfortable. I could go on but suffice it to say I was very pleased with my stay, and although short and sweet this time, I hope to be back for a longer visit in the future."

		"Review": "The Hotel it self just needs major upgrades or rebuild. The two major concerns are both Health Issues(Room #254) The water out of faucets during first use produce a rusty or dirty water. I had to ask for additional water bottles to brush my teeth and rinse with. Very Unhealthy! This should not be an issue for the cost and ratings attached with this hotel. When asked I was told the hotel is just old. ???? The other is the beautiful pool they have as a center of the resort. The pool had green algae in it but when I asked how they cleaned it the staff very surprisingly informed me that they do not have a water filter ration system and they do not change the water out. I watched them just scoop lots of chemicals into the pool after close. So please be careful if you decide to swim in the pool. When the staff advices you to be cautious then this is not good. The rest of the resort is great. The staff is outstanding. I hope they sent a little profit to fix it back up soon. "

Rooms are big but dated and is carpeted and will need replacing soon. The size of the room is quite BIG and provides a lot of room to move around. Bed was big and very soft and provided a good nights sleep. Because the hotel is in their own compound you do not hear any of the street noise. The gym is situated in their own building and looks to be equipped with modern exercise equipment and well maintained. The only disappointing feature of the hotel is the size of the swimming pool, it is relatively small for the size and potential number of guests it can host. Definitely worth staying if you have the opportunity."

It seems like the cooling is not refrigerated and it was not cool 85% of the time. For a very humid place like Davao City it should be refrigerated air. It is located away from the main highway but not too far. It is quiet and the landscape is beautiful. It is nice to walk in the morning around the property grounds not only because it is conducive but it is also safe. It is only a 15 minute boat ride to one of the best beaches in Davao City - Paradise Island Resort. It's also about 25 minutes (if no traffic) from downtown and 20 minutes to the airport. The staff generally were very friendly and they generally greeted you at every opportunity. The rooms were clean but the cleaners kept forgetting certain items each day - a little annoyance. They're still a long ways from communication technology - hard to connect from overseas."

Another concern, we understood that it was the busiest part of the season but having checked us past 2pm (2:30pm exactly) was not acceptable. We even called ahead of time the prior day to confirm our booking and the room we want to stay (front desk- agreed and confirmed to me my request).

When we went to the restaurant at 6 pm, they said it is by reservation only and they would not seat us inside because it is buffet but said we always can dine outside. My ever pleasant husband just agreed. One family was furious about this set up and was complaining to their staff. I went over to them and also explained that since we were guests of the hotel, it should not be a problem seating us for the dinner even if it is buffet by reservation. Apparently, they do not communicate with the front desk. Anywho, management showed up and fixed us a table inside. I was very grateful because there were too many mosquitoes biting outside and was developing so many hives in my skin. Other than this misadventure, our stay was pleasant. They could update the rooms, the one we stayed at was facing a boiler. It was large but dated. But for a temporary stay, it was adequate. Their meals at the restaurant were definitely world class and the service desk were also good. They have great architecture too, and impressive grounds, with adequate parking for a Davao City hotel (it can be problematic). Altogether it is great value for the money."

		"Review": "I have high expectations with Waterfront Insular Hotel in Davao. Though it is one of the oldest hotels in the city, i have considered it as the \"grand dame of hotels\" - the spaciousness, the \"exclusivity\" feel upon entering it's premises, the classic Maranaw architecture that exudes the culture of the place. The \"oldness\" is forgivable, but how can Waterfront give its name to it when the service sucks? The bellboys/attendants do not listen when you give them specific instructions. The room i have reserved should be good for 3 people, but when i came to check, it still has 2 single beds. Wanted to use the gym in the morning, and have repeatedly asked that equipment be turned on. But requests landed on deaf ears. I hope the management would invest in good people who are passionate about their jobs and be willing to seriously take their training, if they have ever undergone such activity. Still commendable is the immaculate garden and good breakfast buffet. "

At 9pm I asked for the volume to be lowered, instead they turned up the bass, and played rock around the clock and wake up little Sussie, with intermittent blasts of rap music with an extremely high bass. I thought this was a slap in the face, since I just asked if they could turn it down. Will never stay here again or recommend to anyone I like."

This was an attempt to SLEEP with the girl I love. I KNOW THE DIFFERENCE! The rest of the staff was great, ESPECIALLY one front desk clerk that took it upon herself, using her own phone (!! :) ) to track down a bag the airline lost. I know a couple of creeps should not prevent me from recommending this hotel but the anger and violence I felt towards these 2 was off the charts. The Management needs to set a new strict policy NO FLIRTING WITH GUESTS! UNTIL then i cannot recommend this hotel yet.

If you love modern style, this is not the perfect hotel for you."

		"Review": "First off: I was staying in the hotel for three nights hence I had breakfast for three days. On each of those 3 days, I had the (dis)pleasure of getting angry glances and rude comments whenever I stuffed my croissant on the communal toaster. There were two toasters - one black and one white. The white one showed maybe a year's worth of blackened, roasted crumbs. The black one, although bearing the same amount of crumbs was less noticeable. Therefore, everyone put their bread on the white one. There was a line for said toaster. Whenever I put a piece of my croissant in the toaster along with other people's bread there, I get weird stares. Please get a rolling-type industrial toaster. Please. On the subject of the room: The room was pretty clean and decent. It is what one will expect in a \"heritage hotel\". There is a flair of old-world grandeur in there. There was, however, a lack of outlets for charging stuff. The AC is also a bit lacking in power. The TOILET NEEDS A FULL RENOVATION. It is like stepping in a shower from the 70s. There was a night where there were a couple of mosquitoes in the room. I got bitten. I called the front desk and they sent staff to spray the room promptly. The hotel facilities are great - especially the pool area. I spent hours and hours there everyday. The pool facilities are resort-like. I would snack there and just lounge! Will I recommend Water Front Insular to friends? Well, yes. But please: 1.) Update the in-room TOILETS 2.) Put more plugs by the bedside 3.) Please liven up the dark hallway leading to the rooms 4.) Please change the toasters in the breakfast outlet Other than that, we're good! "

Please listen to this request and fit double insulated doors so that guests can have the privacy of their own room. "

The deluxe room is great, is spacious and has our needs. The bed is comfortable and the TV has channels for your entertainment.

Wonderful king-sized bed, reliable hot water, warm staff, peaceful tropical ambience, nice little terrace/balcony with small table and chairs. I didn't mind the extra 15- or 20-minute taxi ride downtown (less than US$3) as more centrally located accommodations seem way overpriced. Cheap room was cheap though: scratched-up floor, no bidet, no bathtub, ancient shower, barebones amenities, unattractive view from the window. Strengths: Spacious grounds with soothing water features and lots of greenery; relaxing resort feel; seashore view; impressively renovated facilities. Weaknesses: Those parts not recently renovated definitely showing age; unexciting basic menu; underdeveloped grounds. Particular suggestions: Improve on the tacky concrete items on the grounds (e.g. fugly benches and \"gazebos\" at the beach) and make the swimming facilities bigger and more interesting."

The TV didn't work properly at first and the service had to be in our room for more than 30mins. The hotel looks nice and classy but it's really old. It's really a 4-star hotel on its class but we didn't feel special as guests so we're really disappointed on their service. Everything else, it's good. We usually remember our entire stay, but in this time, we're disappointed by many things. The only thing that we can really appreciate is the Breakfast Buffet."

We asked the staff to investigate. It took them a while to do so but they they could not explain where the noise is coming from. It seems there are visitors at the room upstairs who are busy arranging their luggages, opening cabinets and a phone kept on ringing. They ended up transferring at the pool view which is highly recommended. Apart from that, the outdoor amenities is well maintained and it is very easy to go to Samal Island because the port is just located inside the hotel. Go to Chema's by the Sea and enjoy their pool and food."

The supposed check in time was 2:00pm. We arrived at around 12:30pm. I was asked to wait while they were preparing the room (Deluxe Premium-Pool View). I waited for 30 minutes, the room was still not prepared. I asked the receptionist if we can take our lunch first while they were preparing the room. The girl receptionist commited that when we return from lunch, the room will be ready for us. When we returned, the room is still not available. We waited for 1 hour. I saw all receptionists cramming because more guests were on queue waiting for the room to be available, not only us. When I raised my voice and complained about the poor service, I just don't know what happened, the room key was provided. On the amenities, Beach fronting the Samal Island is a good way to relax but you cannot swim. The shoreline is very dirty, not maintained. You can see garbages around. The swiiming pool is 10 feet deep. If you are not a good swimmer, never mind on this amenity. The pool water is itchy to the Skin. The buffet breakfast was perfect. The room is quite old but still good. Water flow in the bathroom was miserable. When I was in the bathtub, the water on the faucet stopped flowing. Good thing when we called the frontdesk, temporary solution was made. I was advised by the technician that there was leak and needs to be fixed permanently. Overall, this Hotel is only suitable for Big Company Conventions or Seminars. If you wish to find a Hotel to Relax and enjoy the Amenities as couple or family, nevermind. There are still other options out there."

		"Review": "1.We had to request for a room transfer as the room (supposedly one of the newer rooms) was very musty. We could hardly breathe. Our allergies started acting up as the air was heavy, moldy, musty. It was oppressive. 2. The beds were lumpy and every time we moved it would creak and bump into the headboard. 3. The screen door to the balcony fell on us, light bulbs were missing, and amenities were incomplete (i.e. there was shampoo but no soap; they lacked one pair of slippers). 4. The electrical wiring of the lights were odd, such that you had to turn on the hallway lights for the bathroom lights to turn on which made it inconvenient for those sleeping as the hallway light was quite bright. 5. For breakfast, our family (of 3) ordered eggs, bacon/ham, toast, rice. Our order came 50 min after and it was served cold!!! This was when there were only a handful of guests in the dining area. 6.It took us almost an hour just to check in. They need to review their system as it was very inefficient. Imagine, a front desk officer cutting coupons laboriously, while a long line of guests were waiting to be checked in under the heat of an non-ariconditioned lobby. The process took too long. They were apologetic after but we've already suffered the inconvenience. 7. The staff was very accommodating and helpful but I think they could only do so much when the rooms need to be badly re-furbished. 8. They do not deserve the 4 to 4.5 star rating given the overall condition of the rooms and F&B quality and service. I will not recommend staying in this hotel."

Family friendly swimming pool for young and old. What I love about the place was the nature surroundings- the trees, coconut, the well maintained gardens, and the beach (though its not very attractive for a swim). It is a good place for a walk and enjoy the nature if you love walking. I consider this place as one of the relaxing hotel in Davao. Fresher air compare to downtown hotels. Scheduled shuttle bus is available if you need to go to the shopping malls. Foods are quite good! One thing negative is far from grocery/convenient store for emergency or necessary stuff et al. ran out nappies or medicines for my little girl. Over all, the hotel is really good that is why we are back here for our last week before heading back home. I will recommend it to my other friends who wants to visit Davao."

Attention hotel GM: Who in the hell ever came up with the idea to have your main restaurant close for the day after 2PM? I've spent years in the hospitality industry and \"profit or loss\" you don't close your main restaurant on a Friday and tell your guests to go eat in the bar? Really? These little things, and one big thing, won't stop us from staying with you again. The ambience alone is a 9.5. Next time I just know I can get that steak at Café Uno at 6PM. Kudos to your staff. Some really sweet and well trained people trying hard to cover a hotel showing it's age and poor maintenance. I'd fire the GM....."

At 6:30 4:30 hours later the room was still not ready. In fact they rented our second room to some one else and we had to settle for a substitute room, separating our party. We had to put a 1000p deposit for the snack bar in each room, but the snack bar in the second room was locked. When we checked out they asked us for a list of the items we consumed. We gave the best list we could from our head. Then they sent someone to the room to verify our memory. Gosh, when we missed the peanuts, you would have though that we were trying to rob the place. "

Still did not work. I requested for a fan to help cool the room. Other reason why we book the place is because it is beach front. But the beach was full of garbage and disgusting. They have pool but not clean, you will see the dirt in middle of pool. Staff are great. But I think the owner left the place to go down and not well maintained. Not worth it at all ."

On arrival there was only one towel in the room. On a following day, when the room was cleaned, all the towels were taken out and we were left with none. It seemed that everyday we had to call up housekeeping to get the right amount of towels provided. Also, why do most hotels in the Philippines not provide face towels (face washers) in rooms as standard. Even at quality hotels it seems as though you always have to ask for them. Grounds and pool area are quite nice, but would not recommend the beach which is a bit smelly and dirty. Next time I stay in Davao, I'd prefer to stay somewhere else."

		"Review": "I have stayed at the Waterfront Insular a number of times since 2009 so I obviously like it. The restaurants are good, staff delightful, big rooms with nice balconies, and the grounds and swimming pool very good with a delightful ambience. A great retreat from the city and I expect to go back. That said, I'll list the few things I'd like to see fixed. The bathrooms have tubs with the shower within, I estimate the shower head to be about 5ft 8 in above the bottom of the tub. This is a problem for someone taller than that and for me, at 6 ft 4 in, its a real pain. Add to that that the water pressure is not great and even worse when generators are in use and I have to do contortions with my arm up the side of the wall to rinse my body and bend way down to get my head wet. The water pressure problem also effects the sink where you'll often get an explosion of water due to an air bubble when you turn on the sink getting your clothes all wet. One other thing that has always been a problem, the shower curtain does not stop the water from running down outside the tub to the floor and the floor drain is not the lowest spot on the floor so you get quite a substantial puddle that doesn't go away over night - ridiculous. Normally I wouldn't care about this in inexpensive stay overnight hotels but its supposed to be a 4 star hotel. Be careful in the bar, San Miguel beers average about P120 per bottle. When you consider that you can buy the same beer by the case of 24 for about P20 per bottle, the price is steep. Western guests used to much higher prices may not mind but I've lived here a while. Add to that the fact that the bulk of the bar staff were college students on OJT and not being paid and the price is high. We discovered the price when my wife and I noticed there were no patrons and wondered why. Hmmmm. All things considered, I expect to go back, the good far outweighs the bad."
