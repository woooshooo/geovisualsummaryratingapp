The hotel had a bridgeway that connect directly to the hotel. The hotel is also quite close to the airport, so getting there was fast and cabs are usually available. The staff was very friendly and prompt. Some minor issue on the faucet handle being too stiff (probably needed to be changed due to calcium deposits?) and also quite a bit of tiny ants running around the work desk from the time I checked in to check out. I called for housekeeping and their only solution was to use bug spray (Baygon), which I stopped them from using, since the room's window cannot be opened (no way to ventilate). I would stay here again if we have an event in the area."

It is a well run hotel, and well maintained. The staff you directly engage with are lovely, and helpful. The food - room service is varied, interesting, and well prepared. We didn't take the buffet breakfast as I think it is expensive now @ 600p per person, but often you can make a deal on it. If you are an early morning breakfast person you will have a hard time fiding places to eat. If you can wait until 10 there are some inexpensive and good places in the adjacent mall. There are early morning options, but the best of them has closed shop - so if you can make a deal on the buffet breakfast I would. The gym is satisfactory, but not as good as Marco Polo and Abreeza. With a minimum of investment and care they could make it really good, and I hope they do. Better restauranst in adjacent mall."

Location-wise, it's amazing since it's literally 20 steps away from one of the newest and largest malls in the city - SM Lanang Premiere. They even have a walkway connected to the mall itself; you won't have to walk under the heat of the sun to get to the mall. Facility-wise, idk if it's a 5-star hotel but it certainly seems like it, based on all the other 5-star hotels I've stayed in. The bed, the carpet, the air-conditioning system, everything in the room screams 5-star! The pool though is dark blue; I'm not really a fan of pools with dark blue tiles, and it's a bit cramped into their poolside restaurant - it could be improved. And the price is something that ain't practical if you're just gonna go out and about in the city anyway. Park Inn is perfect for staycations in Davao City!"

The beds were comfortable, the linens fresh, and the pillows fluffy. The bathroom was nice, with an overhead hot and cold shower. There were free basic toiletries and clean towels. Our room also had a personal ref, a safe, and a desk. Our room had a nice view of SM Lanang and the swimming pool. The staff were all friendly and helpful. The hotel has a a convenient accessible bridge that connects directly to the mall. The swimming pool though was quite small. We came directly from an overnight stay at the Pearl Farm and we haven't eaten our lunch yet so we ordered pancit at the restaurant, since we were in a hurry and we were running late for the wedding. Our order unfortunately arrived late (I had to follow up twice), and the food was very salty. Overall though, our stay at this hotel was quite satisfactory."

Very obtrusive. On my second day, one of the cleaners approached me, looked at his paper, called me by my name, and said \"Mr. --, nice to meet you.\" A simple good morning would've been ok. This guy was bordering on being a stalker. Aside from this, the prices are on the high side considering the room isn't that great. My room had molds on the edges of the floor.

The floor/carpet felt like it was not vacuumed. After a few days I asked for a better view of the SM Lanang so they moved me to the 4th floor facing the mall and I was happy, the room that I got was clean and vacuumed.

I decided to book a function room as well for my son's birthday celebration. I only correspond to the banquet officer through email, and it was practically challenging to get her reply. Since I have already made a downpayment there was no point of cancelling, so we go ahead. On the event, she wasn't there. She didn't include an item which I asked, and when I complained to the supposed to be manager in charge for the event - he claimed that it was all but fault from the banquet officer because she didn't informed them. Talk about owning responsibility, huh? No point to get pissed off since there was celebration. However upon checking out, I was surprised with the bill. Apparently there system is not updated and the downpayment made was not reflected. We demand to speak to the manager. And there she is ... After what seems to be almost half an hour of waiting! While their Housekeeping team is excellent, and the front desk officer is good, how unsatisfactory the service from the banquet officer and weekend manager was what reminds of me the hotel. Not recommended for a breezy celebration!"

It lacks also the usual things that we need in the bathroom like cotton buds, shower cap etc. although there's a card there that says we can request but how can u request when u are already naked. These are essentials in the bathroom of a 3-4star hotel. And the soap is tiny winy. Food was a-ok,not much to be raved about"
