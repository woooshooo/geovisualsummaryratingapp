Next morning was told that the lampshade was for 2100 php and they charged me for same, when I asked for discount for putting me in a furnace for 9 hours, the front office girl said that “ you already had been given discount by Agoda so no further discount for non functional air conditioning. It till 20 minutes for house keeping to call reception to clear that room was okay and I can check out. I have traveled all over the world and this was a nightmare "

The smell like it has been there for some time and wasn't change or washed.The pool is enticing in the pictures on the website however when we were there it's small and guest like us need to share it with people from outside since they have a summer training ongoing. It was just disappointing that you can't enjoy the pool since it was too crowded. There was no safe where we can put our valuables and keep it secure whenever we need to go out. We used our luggage bag instead. My son notice that the elevator smell liked vinegar that you can't even stand it. We need to hold our breath whenever we use the lifts. Moreover, the food that was served everyday for breakfast were so delicious and made us full. The location of the Hotel is so convenient that some of the tourist spots in Davao are walking distance too bad it's raining so much when we had our vacation. "

The hotel is situated in a very crowded city center. The only this i like is the nice lobby and sumptous breakfast buffet. The check in process was a disappointment, we booked 3 rooms and upon arrival at almost 5pm 1 room we booked is still not ready to occupy. After an all day sightseeing tour and with 3 elderly in our group of course i was upset. The room key cards malfunctioned in all 3 rooms that we had to go up and down to the lobby for a replacement at least 10x and i'm not exaggerating. "

They attend to your concern with a smile and a genuine disposition to assist in every way. This is a hotel that takes care of their staff, who in turn take good care of their guests. Thank you. Next time I am back in Davao, I will make it a point to stay there."

Free pool access included. No additional cost for the extra beach towels. Excellent WiFi connection that I was able to stream an hour long video without any lag! AC is a super yes too! Unlike an inn we went after, the AC here is way much cooler. Lastly, the buffet breakfast is more than satisfactory! Heavy breakfast meal just right for a day-long city/Samal Island tour. We'll definitely recommend this with friends and other travelers! My boyfriend even wants us to go back here when we visit Davao again in the next Kadayawan Festival."

Room internet was slower than 1980 dial-up.... and it did not work at all after 8 a.m. They have a \"business center\" with a hard wired desktop that I was able to get on line with after a long wait for it to boot up. I had to print on a printer that only had used paper available. Booking a flight and checking my email took long hours. Totally non-functional if you need to communicate or do any business on line. Computer desk was hand made with a straight back chair. No lights in the business center. More like a large closet with windows. The neighborhood is not tourist friendly for foreign tourist. It is a long taxi ride to any of the better malls. The menu in the room shows only the over-priced items. If you go down to the pool area you will pay about 30% of the room service prices and have a better selection. Room was noisy from music played at the pool area. Breakfast buffet was very good. Bathroom and bed was good. I have a rental property in Davao but live on a farm in del Norte when I am in the Philippines. I usually stay at the Red Planet in Davao and in Luzon. It was not available this time so I took this hotel. This one was more expensive but cannot beat red planet hotel for internet, TV, location and value. I hope this helps my fellow travelers and I also hope it help that hotel fix these issues.... at least the internet and the lighting. KuyaKano "

The towels are gray in color instead of white. They need to use some Clorox. The rooms really needs to be renovated. I paid for a 4 star hotel and got a 1 star or even 0 star. It's just like staying at Motel 6 maybe motel 6 is even better. The hotels condition really ruined my only 2 days vacation in Davao. I really do not understand why they were rated 4 star. We asked to be moved to another room but they said they were booked - we truly believe they were lying too. I am asking for the hotel industry to recheck this hotel to properly rate it."

This is where it starts to get really bad. Our room was on the third floor where the grill was, and there was a band that played every night I think. We could hear them from our room, though it was tolerable. Right as you exit the elevator to the 3rd floor you will realize ventilation is not so good in this place. But it gets worse in the room. I had colds already, but the poor ventilation (you could tell by the smell) in the room made it harder for me to breathe. So to make things easier for me, I checked if I could open the windows—I could, but the bad thing is that it was unlocked and I know people could open it from outside. Security issues. There were also a lot of mosquitoes. TV was working, but there were not many channels and they were redundant, which was annoying every time I surfed. Toilet and bath: Pretty basic. Surprisingly, the condition is not much worse than the condition of the room. I always bring my toiletries, so I can't say much about theirs. Internet: Did not work half the time we were there. When it did, it was slow anyway so I had to use my mobile provider's mainly. Location: There's a bank nearby, convenience and drug stores, a few minutes away is a mall... Definitely would not stay here again."

Did not inform me that they keep changing the wifi password..so i have to ask everyday which the receptionist answers rudely and put the phone first... I mean, i paid for my stay so i should have atleast get a good service... I eas acused of getting the towels...which it is so humilliating..knowing i travel and checked in hotels so much... And its the housekeeping is the dishonest one... No bathrobs and shower gel, bar soap only they have... Squeeking noisy sound in my bed..so its kinda uncomfortable... REALLY A VERY BAD EXPERIENCE!!! I will never go to this hotel ever!!,"

Once I entered the lobby, I knew I made the right move. The customer service was excellent, even bringing me a drink at check-in for free. The room was also great with all the comforts needed for a hotel stay. The pool area was nice and relaxing also. The free breakfast in the morning was excellent with once again great customer service and a vast variety of food to choose from. Peoples Park is a 5 minute walk away and a great place for jogging, walking, picture taking, etc... I now know where I will stay everytime I will be in Davao City and I am looking forward to my next visit. "

All staff are courteous and really helpful. The buffet breakfast is really good, value for your money. The location of the hotel is very much accessible from all the tourist attractions of Davao City. I just hope they will improve the wireless connection as there are times that the wifi speed is quite slow but overall it is ok. I will recommend this to my family and friends who will spend their vacation in Davao. All hotel staff are well commended. Thank you for making our Davao vacation worth it."
