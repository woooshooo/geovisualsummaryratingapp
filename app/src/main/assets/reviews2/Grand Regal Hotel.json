Buffet breakfast included in the price of the room was good - just make sure you are down for breakfast before 8:30am - after that items don't get re-supplied and those not popular items sitting since 6:00am are just cold. Staff friendly and very proud of their City and the property - Thumbs up !!!"

I was pissed off that time because they knew that they have many guests that day but they do not refill the food immediately it's okay if they have plenty of food to choose from but they only have few. ✔ Should I recommend this hotel? Yes."

When I arrived at the front desk, the lady staff did not even say a quick good morning or smile in acknowledgement, just continued with what she was doing with another client. After close to 10 minutes of waiting, that is when I asked \"miss, is there no one else who can assist me, I have an early meeting\". That is when she acknowledged me and proceeded with my check-in process. The supervisor also seems to be in an unhappy mood that morning. Oh well, everything else was OK. "

The rooms are spacious, the bed is hug and the view from the 10th floor is awesome- The room are equiped with a big bed, normal sized cr, tv, fridge and a desk. And an old carpet. You get all you need, but it´s not like a 4 star hotel. ZThe breakfast is ok. The best is really the staff which is very helpful. The hotel is located close to SM Lanang and close tht airport. So that´s a big pro for the Grand regal. "

They do not refill outright. The taste is also average. "

But for the P 2,000 - P 4,000.00 range I would say that this hotel is value for money due to its large rooms, fairly good breakfast, location (in the middle of the busy JP Laurel Avenue), close to good restaurants and SM Lanang Mall. Would help if you renovate the pool, arrange a new band and light up the hotel a little more from the outside to attract more visitors. "

Though furnitures are old, they were enough for temporary storage of guests belongings. The room was of good size with a king size bed for relaxing sleep. The bathroom faucet and shower head should be more clean and shiny to be appropriate for a hotel. The front desk staff was friendly, airport transfer service included in room rate was helpful. We thank the manager for arranging to provide us early breakfast at 3 a.m., because we were fasting for Ramadan. We appreciate your respect for our faith. Overall, we had a good stay at Grand Regal Hotel in Davao."
