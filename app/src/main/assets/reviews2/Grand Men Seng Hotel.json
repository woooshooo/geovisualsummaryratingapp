I was surprised they put 2 extra beds aside from 2 double beds. the best part was the buffet breakfast which u dont get from other hotels. there was also a swimming pool where my daughter loves to swim. the downside is that there are lesser shops outside, like cafes or convenience stores where u can run some errands.
