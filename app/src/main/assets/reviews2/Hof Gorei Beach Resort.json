The food was exceptional and the animals (birds, ducks, geese, and chickens) on the property give the Hof Gorei a unique style that compliments its lush surroundings. The pool is well shade and on a steep section of the resort. Totally serene and tranquil. Low or high tide swimming at the beach is a delight. Sunsets at the end of the pier- come and see for yourself you will be captivated by the anchored boats and the mountain range on the horizon. "

EXCEPTIONALY nice room sa beach front. Napakaganda, although wala silang cable sa tv, reasonable dahil di ka naman nagpunta dun para manuod ng tv but to enjoy nature. Good food at a reasonable, reasonable ang sinabi ko because it is not cheap pero the presentation, the taste and the serving says it all. We stayed here for 3 days.Beach is great! White sand, crystal clear waters! Payo lang po, if you have plans of getting tour packages, better get it from the resort. Also, kung di ka sumasakay/umaangkas ng motorcycle, dont get the inland tour. Habal lang ang nakaka labas pasok sa resort at di kaya ng sasakyan. Will try the island hopping pag nakabalik. Worth coming back? Definitely a YES! Salamat po for making our 3 day stay a very wonderful experience."

Everything is at your finger tips with just a ring of the bell and your personal assistant is there to help you. Room was quite large and bed was very comfortable. Room safe is also available but I left my stuff out and did not have an issue with anything missing. TV was provided but only local channels and no cable but why would you need that at a resort. WIFI is also not available but was not an issue getting internet access via GLOBE or SMART from our phones. Jacuzzi and swimming pool well maintained and we used both several time. Jet ski, kayaking, banana boat all available through the resort. Food is excellent and service is great! I cannot speak enough good things about this place and will definitely go back when the opportunity allows. Do not hesitate to book this resort if you have the chance."

Every thing is charged, 1/2 litre water at 38pesos, 1 hour Jetski at 5000pesos, average dishes at 350pesos... Water of swimming pool not clean, beach chalet quite small and no wardrobe to put our clothes. Night at 6pm and nothing to do in the evening. TV is only few philipinos channel, a DVD player with few movies will have been welcome to entertain the evening. Snorkeling is very disappointing all around Samal island. No fish and coral not nice or dead. Not worth the money! "

The place is tired and run down, It is overrun with cats dogs and Fowl making horrendous noise all night not to mention the droppings everywhere. Eating lunch on the beach, dogs constantly sat at the table evening dinner no better at Alfresco, my daughter plagued by cats around her legs. I had to chase off, All beverages were almost 2 1/2 times the price in any other hotel we stayed in Davao. At the pool our son aged 2 intimidated by and threatened by Geese wandering freely around the pool. Only swift action by the pool attendant prevented him being pecked. The staff were very accommodating and helpful. All on the brochure and in reality differs a great deal "

The beach was not that great, too many corals; would recommend to wear a beach shoes. Since i did not enjoy the beach, i had my dips in the pool. I kinda enjoyed it. But there were floating leaves and insects. No loud videoke which is great.. Was able to relax the whole night."

Funny thing though that the welcome drinks and the ice-cold towel offered upon arrival somewhat did not blend into the current weather. Haha. The butler assigned to us seemed to be a trainee because when I asked about info especially about their menu, she always say she doesn't know. Anyway, another butler accompanied her right in time before I almost complain. From that time until checkout, there are two butlers approaching us for our needs. Good thing! :-) We took our lunch, dinner and our complimentary breakfast here. I should say that their food tasted great! Don't ever miss their take on tinola! However, as others say, their entire menu is somewhat pricey and I can't get why the 12% VAT is separated from the printed price. If the management reads this review, I suggest you incorporate it on the price itself or make it a service charge or some other term. "

		"Review": "What amazed me about this resort is the butler system. Although i would like to think this the perfect beach resort for the budget traveller, the place does need to at least make itself presentable. It's like a zoo. Chickens and dogs were running around and poo of those were almost everywhere. Constant cleaning is needed, but obviously manpower is lacking. Not sure if the pool is barely used, but when I went there, the water was swimmable, but a lot of debris and ants around the pool. Then again, regular cleaning is needed. For those who booked in rooms NOT close to the ocean, be ready to walk some stairs. Especially the huts and the house overlooking the ocean. The view is simply the best, but at the cost of your leg. The name of the resort wasn't even obvious at the port. Not advertising \"Welcome to Hof Gorei\" at the front is not good advertising as well. The beach area is well-maintained and the beach is nice to swim in. In fact, id rather prefer this than the pool."

We also enjoyed walking on the beach front, well maintained with white sand and prestine blue water, and watched the beautiful sunset. We requested to have our dinner at the beach front and we are so satisfied with the set-up and the food is absolutely delicious. Travel going there and back to the City is convenient because they provide boat transfers on Santa Ana wharf. Overall, it was a very nice experience and we'll definitely go back there in the future..."

The boat ride is free it is included when you booked a room from them.Staff is really nice ( well i thought davaoenios are very stiff and not approachable haha ) special mention to \"Ate Thang\" i highly recommend her when you visit the resort you can request from the resort for her as your personal Service Crew/Staff.

Having breakfast at Hill Hut terrace is awesome, you can see mountain Apo if the weather is clear. Dinner at beach can see the sunset. You can indulge yourself into the quiet and peaceful nature at Hof Gorei. The whole resort is designed like a tropical garden. There is an outside swimming pool, looks really nice. Everything's awesome, except the snorkeling tour to Tulicud Island. It's not worth the money at all! 4288P for two person! Only went to two places maximum 2 hours in the water! And with other guests! Lunch on the island was just fine. We didn't get any special care even we told our butler that neither my husband nor I can swim. No professional tour guide providing any service under water! It's overcharged and not equivalent the service. And we didn't see any attractive corals at these two places at all! Summary: 1. Resort itself is awesome, strongly recommend, especially for couples. The atmosphere here is full of romance. 2. Snorkeling tour service to Tulicud Island is too much overpriced! Not recommend! 3. The resort location is far from the town. The butler called us two motorcycles, round trip fee at 1000P is also overpriced! Suggest call the motorcycle by yourself outside the resort. Butler service need to be improved. We asked for boat fishing service at least two times, but no response. Motorcycle arrangement for us is good, but overpriced too much! No room cleaning service during our two-night stay. Safe-box in the room was out of work. "

We informed ate tang ( our personal buttler) and she immediately checked the bathroom and told us to use the other bathroom which is just located 10steps away from our room. The view is is magestic though you really have to take looooong stairs going to the top of the resort. The beach area is soooo clean. The food is expensive BUT its worth the price because the serving is big enough to be shared by 2 ( just have to buy 1 extra rice, we ordered baby back ribs ). The hotel owner is very nice and accomodating ( you actually cant tell that shes the owner because shes very simple looking ). What's extra special in our stay is their tour guide ( TEDDY the schitzu ) who always follow us wherever we go.

The staff here are awesome and go the extra step to make your stay an enjoyable one. There are FANTASTIC dive sites only 15 minutes away, and snorkelling off the beach front. This is the best resort I have stayed at in the Philippines and certainly they have the best food. The prices can not be beaten elsewhere, and the rooms are a total delight. The greatest care has been taken to all the small details. The garden surrounding the resort are home to some of the rarest and most exotic plants you will see anywhere. Orchids and Hibiscus stud these magnificent grounds."
