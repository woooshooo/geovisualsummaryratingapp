I realized that after my Baguio City visit last November 2017.\r \r My most recent visit to Eden Nature Park was on July 2017 with my brothers and nieces. We enjoyed fishing under the drizzling noon and we had them fried and cooked as sinigang on a pot of clay! My favorite spot was the Rainbow Pass and just \"bathing\" under the forest cool sunshine and pristine air! Rejuvenating! Family and friends always enjoy the fun and excitement of the zipline plus the jumping high in the air groupie pic!\r \r My first time and second time to visit Eden Nature Park was to attend USIP conferences in 2005 when I was still based in Jolo, Sulu. The accommodation including the food was very pleasant. Our bedroom was very comfortable. The place is very soothing and blissful.\r \r I got to enjoy and drink all in the clean environment on my third visit because I personally chose Eden to be the place for our school field trip. It is the best spot to take your learners along with their parents to an educational trip and teach them about trees, protecting the environment, and about integrity of creation with The Creator Allah like we did for Al Munawwara Islamic School (AMIS) in 2011. Eden is Muslim-friendly, we were allowed to eat our baon halal food and to perform salah for dhuhr and asr. Alhamdulillah!"

Situated on the mountain, Eden feels like a more modern adult summer camp.\r \r in addition to walking the grounds and seeing the greenery, you can also add some thrilling activities to your itinerary. During our trip we tried the Skyswing,Skyrider and Skycycle. The Skyswing takes you far up top before the rope releases you and you \"swing\" to a stop. The Skyrider is named for the zipline, letting you ride across the grounds twice. The Skycycle gives you the chance to bike across a tightrope held at a great height above the ground. The three \"sky\" activities were all very much worth it. Horseback riding ended up just being the a horse being led around a small track twice--I would recommend skipping this one."

		"Review": "Eden Park is a huge property, but ideal for people of all ages since they are offering guided tours where you'll ride on their jeeps with one guide to explain things you see around. There are also stopovers that will let you do picture-taking. But just like usual guided tours, it is always timed, which means that you do not have control over the time you'd want to spend on a certain area. After the tour, you have all the time to do your own exploration of the place. The package we had included a hearty lunch buffet, which is sufficient. Our only suggestion is to come here early as people tend to flock starting around 10am, and you'll have to be at the buffet area the moment it opens (I believe at around 11 or 11:30. Fret not if you don't feel like eating that much as there are also stalls like Aling Foping's halo-halo that is also offering light snacks like bibingka. We only stayed until about 2pm because we opted not to try other activities anymore like the skycycle, etc. We also didn't want the influx of crowd that usually comes at a later time of the day. Being surrounded by nature and having a hearty, healthy lunch was enough for us. I'd like to reiterate that you'll need to be early (they open at 8am) or better stay in one of their accommodations to truly experience the place."

		"Review": "After you have overcome the getting there, and arranging the getting back, you can certainly enjoy a peaceful day in gardens, on rides, eating, and walking about.\r \r TIP: If you don't have a car. Arrange a taxi for the day. 2500 pesos. He will take you there, wait, then take you home. When you add up the fare there and the return fare, it's almost the same anyway and at least you have a guarantee of getting home.\r If you have been lucky enough to get a taxi to take you there (700php -1000php), the Park Reception will order one to take you home. But there is a time limit to be able to do that.\r We made two mistakes - arriving late (about 2pm) and thinking we could get a ride home or at least down to the main town area below on a tricycle. Wrong! We ended up on the back of motorbikes, racing down the mountain. It was fun and at 50php each, a lot cheaper. Just don't depend on this.\r Okay, that's the transport. Let's talk about the park.\r You pay to enter, around 200php and that includes a snack at the restaurant. The fee is reasonable, the snack, (I had spaghetti), was just fine.\r The gardens and the walks and the scenery are quite lovely and a nice cool atmosphere away from the humidity of the city down below. There are horse rides, tame but great for kids and nervous partners, the sky bikes, safe fun and a great view, and the sky swing, heart stopping release followed by the feeling of butterflies wanting to escape from your tummy before it stops.\r Eden Park caters for overnight stays as well with cottages, different charges for different levels, of course, and there are pools and playgrounds. Accommodation was not cheap but if there were, say, a group of you, 8 - 10 people, then a mountain villa for about 12,000php is a pretty cool idea!\r The place is huge and if the rides aren't your thing, then romantic or discovery walks should fit the bill nicely.\r It's a perfect place to bring kids and you can guarantee they will sleep all the way home. :)\r Also a perfect place for a couple, and guys, if you want to take your partner somewhere romantic to propose, this could be memorable. Shout out \"Marry me!\" as they let the sky swing go. Her scream might be a yes, or just sheer terror. Add a bit of romance to the trip home by leaving late and having to ride pillion together on the back of a motorcycle with her hanging on to you from behind as you descend the mountain.\r Eden Park is a great day out."

This can be both a day time excursion or a place to stay. But I've only been here as a day tour from Davao. The main attraction is the nature park itself. But for those who like to spend a bit of time fishing in a pond or to experience a bit of rush. There area options available right there.\r \r I've visited the park several times now and it's actually a really nice experience. The guided tour takes you through what is a man made park, that tries to give you a sense of both what was there before the area was settled by the Spanish and some of the local flowers and fauna. It's a good experience for all ages and offers some great photo opportunities. \r \r Included in the price of entry is a buffet lunch which was really nice. There's plenty of variety and anyone should be able to eat their fill. Happy to have been here again and very easy to recommend as one of the top destinations in Davao."

She was simply amazed how beautiful the place is. And I was surprised that they have improved their system from the entrance, to the day tour to their lunch buffet . And I should give credit to our tour guide ( sorry I forgot her name ) . She is very informative and makes you feel that she is happy doing her job. Oh, there is a cut off time in the morning day tour. When we arrived that morning, we were told that the last day tour in the morning is at 10:45, and the next one is at 1 pm. I was quite disappointed because that means we have to wait. Then before I start feeling so disappointed, we were told that there is a group of 5 and they could squeeze in another day tour before the lunch buffet. Yes! So we ended up having the day tour and enjoyed the lunch buffet after. Sum it all up, excellent day for us."

The fish are trapped in a small area and hungry, so when you put your loaded hook in front of them what do you think they are going to do. The worst part though is the horse riding. The poor creatures looked starved and barely capable of carrying a Philippine person, and as I weigh around twice that amount I cancelled my ride in the fear I would hurt one of the four `ponys` that had the task of none stop running around carrying whomever chose to ay. I found it sad that despite the obvious profit that these animals were generating for the place they were underfed and cared for. I would first suggest that a weight restriction be placed on this event. I was even more upset when I reported my thoughts to the main booking place and the girl said you foreign visitors are always complaining about this."

Their website is not in operation and they did not respond to my text or email. My daughter is a big fishing fanatic so we got the P400 fishing village package. (Amount is consumable.) We took the shuttle tour (P120 / person) to have a guided tour of the place. Tour was just ok with a lot of picture perfect opportunities. Tour lasted for about an hour with three stops: Flower garden / Ampitheater, Tinubdan (cultural dance, tribal houses, medicinal herb garden), and Lola’s garden.\r \r My children were not interested with any of their rides but they did enjoy catching fish. We missed the sign that says you need to pay for all the fish caught (you can’t throw them back in) so we ended up with 4 kilos of Tilapia for lunch. >.< Charge for the Tilipia + cooking fee is almost at P400/kilo! Aside from the Tilapia catch, you can order other items on their menu (sinigang, salad, pancit noodles). Their grilled tuna belly was quite good. Food is not cheap and the I paid for the most expensive Tilapia meal in my entire life’s existence. (I can buy live tilapia in Manila for P120/kilo without the need to fish for it. hahaha). \r \r After lunch, we visited the aviary and the butterfly garden. The aviary is just ok. Nothing we haven’t seen from our numerous visits to zoos and aviaries. We had fun in the butterfly garden because the attendant was very knowledgeable and accommodating. My boys love insects (ew....) so they enjoyed handling the butterflies, caterpillars, larvae and walking sticks (of all sizes and colors!). We appreciated the interaction and what we learned that day because of the attendant in the butterfly garden. He even challenged us to find the walking sticks in the garden. They are definitely not easy to find as they can “play dead” and fold up their legs to appear like a stick.\r \r TIPS\r * Eden opens at 9am. Arrive early to beat the heat and the crowd. \r * If you opt for the fishing village package, reserve a hut right after your shuttle tour. You can order ahead then head across the park for the rides. \r * Bring sunblock and insect repellant"

Eden Nature Park is a far in a downtown area in Davao City but its not a hassle because we had a jeep to go in these place . when you go Eden nature park you can ride a jeep then after a jeep motorcycle the price is 200 per 2 person . and this place was a friendly and nature place because of their facilities, and their rides .they have may rides in eden which can give us a memorable moment when you experience that activities."

		"Review": "First off, we commuted going there. From the downtown area it wasnt difficult to get a jeep and get off the main road going to the venue. The motorcycle ride going up to Eden was a lot of fun. Just make sure to haggle the price (when we went it was 150 for 2 pax so price could be a little bit higher by now. Shouldnt be more than 200 for 2 pax one way). \r \r Second, food at Eden was average. The day we went it was the typical Filipino fare. The package we got included lunch so I would say fairly priced.\r \r Third, the room. It was bigger than most hotels or resorts here in Davao. The bathroom has a little nook where it has plants. There's cable tv but no AC. That being said, that was a concern at first but when nightfall came the temperature dropped a bit. There's a ceiling fan if you still need a slight breeze when you sleep. \r \r The area overall for sightseeing is really nice. You have an option to either hike or ride their guided tours. We went hiking down this path where the guided tours dont take. For someone who's used to hiking untouched terrain, you might like it. The place has little falls ans beautiful streams. It's a nice quiet place to be one with nature. \r \r There are other activities than you can do at the venue however they charge a fee. We didnt avail of that option since the hike alone was enough to exhaust us! BTW, be warned that if you visit the venue by taking public transport, better wear your most comfy outfit (sneakers, jeans, t shirt) and bring extra shirt should you get sweaty in the process when you hike.

		"Review": "It's my 4th time to visit Eden Nature Park, but its our first time to go there using public transportation that's why I decided to write a review since most visitors are backpackers. We are actually residing also in Toril (Centro) so it easier to find ways of going there. From Mercury Drug, for backpackers you may hire a motorcycle (habal2x) and pay P100/head. Or if you are a group you may hire a taxi and pay P500.00 (4-5 cap.)\r It will only take about 20 minutes to get there. Entrance Fee includes meal, either plated snacks of P220 (adult) or P190(child) or you may avail of buffet lunch of P550 and P350 respectively. In our case, we chose plated snacks since we want to stay at the Skyview Cafe while waiting for our sched for the recreational rides. \r Upon our arrival at 10AM, we immediately started our tour of the place by having pictorials on various \"eden landmarks\" near the daytour center (instead of booking for a shuttle tour). Among them are the souvenir shop, aviary, fernery, fishing village, swimming pool and butterfly garden. Realizing that the nature park is about 40hectares ( and we have not much time to do the mountain trekking), we decided that we need to book for a shuttle tour service (P120/head) since we have a guest from Iligan who need to see the whole place. Since, our shuttle tour is scheduled by 3pm we proceeded to the Eden Sports field just across the nature park and see the recreational activities they are offering: Skyrider (P150), skycycle (P200), combo skyrider&cycle (P300), skyswing (P300 for solo & P400 for tandem). If you are however afraid of height you may enjoy horseback riding for P100.00, go fishing for P40/head or enjoy the cold swimming pool for P80/adult and P55/child. Among said activities, I opt for the newest and most challenging.. the SKYCYCLE! It was such a great experience as compared to skyrider where you will only sit down.. zipline-like. In skycycle you get to experience the heart-thumping feeling once you are already sitting on the bike, holding the brakes while waiting forbthe gate to be opened. Once it is opened you have to decide to backout or go for it and face your fear on a metal rope! \r If you are CRAVING for adventure, greater heights, challege of a lifetime...skyswing is a must-try! While said activities are for the adults and fearless, kids may enjoy the \"indiana jones\" rides which is free and unlimited.\r By 3pm, shuttle tour starts with a tourguide, passing through the Deer park, hydrophonic gardens, mangosteen orchard, dragonfruit farm, flower garden, ampitheater, Tinubdan where a group of cultural dancers will welcome the group with dances, there are also native huts and man-made cave (fiberglass). The tour will then proceed to ornamental nursery, fruit tree collection, herb garden and last stop is Lola's Garden where that famous wishing well with lots of hibiscus flowers, carabao statue, amazing view of the davao gulf. The tour will take about 45minutes to 1hour.\r The whole experience is full of fun especially because of the new activities/rides that they've added. Although it would have been better if they will also make a picnic area for families and groups."

		"Review": "Getting there: It's approximately 1 to 1.5 hours from the City. You can take a taxi but be prepared to pay 2x the fare. This is because the place is out of the way and taxis will most probably not have passengers on the way back. Estimated fare: P450 (x2, so it's P900 total). I suggest to call before you go there, just to make sure that the attractions are open or that the place isn't closed off for a big event. There's a section of the road that's winding so if you tend to get car sick, make the necessary preparations. I also suggest to go there in the morning, so that you can maximize your stay. They close at 5-ish but you can still walk around on your own. \r \r Suggestion to the management: Please consider organizing shuttle tours that will pick guests up from their hotels (or one hotel, which can be a meeting place for all) in the city and bring them back. \r \r What to wear / bring: Plenty of insect repellent. Wear comfortable shoes because you will be doing a lot of waking. For this same reason, bring plenty of water. Because it's high in the mountain, it might get a bit cold in the mornings and afternoons. So, bring a jacket or a shawl.\r \r Going around Eden: It's a huge place and we were traveling with our 83 year old grandmother, so we opted for the guided tour. This entails a separate payment from the entrance fee. The tour itself was good. The guide was lively, and he had plenty of information and side stories to tell. It took about 45 minutes to go around the place. I felt that is wasn't enough time to truly enjoy the sights. It was a challenge for my grandma too, because she couldn't move very quickly. I suggest to the management to make it at least an hour. The tour comes with a free snack, which is good to take after the tour. (Not before, because the winding roads might not be friendly to a full belly). \r \r There are other activities and attractions like the zipline and the aviary. You can also go hiking. \r \r Overall, it's a fun place to spend a day. The fees are a bit expensive but worth it when you see that the place is that well-maintained."

Then after paying the P220/person I mentioned to the cashier that we will do the zipline while waiting for the tour. She then said to go inside the park (park and activities such as zipline/horseback riding are in separate locations, you have to cross the street) to confirm the tour as it is first come first served. So I went inside the park and presented my ticket thinking they were going to list our names for the tour. The lady said I have to pay P120/person for the tour. I was very surprised and asked her what was the P220.00 I paid for, she said it was for the entrance fee and the snack! The cashier at the front made it seem like the tour was included in the P220. She should have informed me that I need to pay for the tour inside! But she said you need to \"confirm\"!!! She should have said you need to pay for the tour inside. Also, the Management thought of feeding the guests even if the guests doesn't want to eat! Give the guests the option to buy your food!!! What if your guests just had something to eat or doesn't want to eat especially if they are going to be ziplining or horse back riding. Also, why separate the cashier location for the tour, it should just be at the entrance too. Then I asked the lady at the Tour section if we could just go around on our own and she said yes but you cannot bring your car. I went back to the entrance and asked for our money back!"

I find the park nice place to unwind and have some activities like camping and bonfire, but I am expecting some improvements to make it a tourist destination by international standard. Set up a viewing deck to have a glimpse of Davao City and environs, more choices of foods, a showcase of tribal culture and practices, lessons in jungle survival, add more fun activities for the kids and the young at heart a bird show or an encounter with an exotic animals, a butterfly garden, to name a few."

I don't think so. \r \r Starting from the entrance fee which includes either meal or snacks to the rides that cost Ps 120 per person for 30 minute round about in the forest with stop over taking pictures of flowers gardens is overrated. \r \r There are rides you can try if those are your kind of fun but still, I find them overrated. If you have taken rides in other world class theme parks, this is probably not even half the standard of fun but they charge you like they feel they are world class (which is not). \r \r I would not recommend it at its current state."

There are so much to see like their butterfly house and bird display, the flower area, the different plants and trees like marang and durian trees, the dragon fruit plant etc. The one i liked best is the place where their ancestors are featured, they even have a short presentation. Their receptionists are very attentive and considerate. They did not hesitate when we asked for a refund when we decided not to get their buffet lunch package and changed our choice to their plated snack. Highly recommended is the sky adventure located opposite the parj entrance. We had a great time with their exciting and breathtaking skybike, skyswing and the zipline. Not to mention the beautiful view of the ocean, mountain and lush greenery surrounding us."

My husband and i had severe headaches that time thus patience is limited...ano ba yan! We were not told when we did the booking 2 hours ago. The skyview cafe -- the venue was ok, though a little crowded as it is a closed venue unlike in the vista. The kids had a lot of games, best in costume and decorate your cupcake contests, and of course the trick or treating---- they went to 3 sites and were given candies/loot bag. They were also given the certificate of participation. The snacks was ok---though not healthy (standard: spag, hotdog and brownies). Over-all, the kids really enjoyed the event and that's what more important to us. Improvement points for next year: (i) pls fix the venue ahead of time (ii) adults are paying php220 each for the snacks, we dont eat bread/spag so i hope you have an option if we can just take your vegetable pack and 1 bottle salad dressing---or any option similar to that.

But if you ride a jeepney to Toril, drop off at Mercury Toril and ride a motorcycle to Eden Park, it will probably take you one and a half to two hours (without traffic).\r This is a mountain resort. Since it usually rains here in the afternoons, schedule an early morning visit.Avoid visiting during holidays, as locals and tourists flock the place. \r I recommend the one hour shuttle tour, it will take you around their gardens, vegetable farms and the scenic spots in this resort. I'm impressed by how the owners utilized the vast area, turning it into a mountain resort with its cute cottages, fish pond, organic farms that provide fresh vegetables for their buffet (their vegetables are also sold in SM supermarkets), fruit plantations and cultural village with natives in their traditional garb and exhibiting tribal dances. It's also amazing how despite all these, the owners were able to maintain the natural diversity and landscape of the place.\r For meals, they serve plated snacks and lunch buffet. I've tried the buffet, it has a variety of good food. I was delighted with the freshly picked vegetables, salad dressings, fresh fruits, pasta and meat dishes. I didn't sample their lechon belly, as they didn't serve it during my visits, but from what I've heard, it's heavenly.\r I cannot enumerate every recipe I 've tried, but when it comes to presentation, freshness, taste, and variety, I'd rate it 4.9 out of 5. \r This place also boasts of a zipline and skycycle but I haven't tried these.\r I roamed the grounds on my own and enjoyed a view of the sea and the cool mountain air.\r The only disappointments I encountered are the seemingly old and not so well-maintainedfish pond. You can catch your own fish here and have it cooked according to your preference. I was about to do so until I noticed how murky and foul smelling the water in the fishpond is. \r To wit, a visit here is worth the long trip. It's a great place with great food."

		"Review": "Stayed last June 2015 with family and friends as part of our \"quality time\" . My sister and I , along with our families now live abroad and my mom was just diagnosed with terminal illness.Lovely place but not suitable for the elderly with balance/mobility problems. Shuttle to and from rooms is a big plus.\r \r Rooms are big but needs redecorating . The screen of our window is ripped . Lucky we didn't have mosquito bites.\r \r Restaurant service/ food is terrible. We tried to order lunch at the restaurant but were told to go to the ?cafe as they serve lunch there for the guests on day tour. I explained that we are not on a day tour but were pointed to the direction of the cafe anyway. Paid a lot of money for below par small serving of microwaved spaghetti and sandwich as there is nothing else available (The staff serving us rang the kitchen) . 8 year old was still hungry and my mom hardly touched her food. Breakfast was equally disappointing . Not much on the buffet and when we asked why the table next door has corned beef they put some on our table too(???) So if we didn't ask for it, we won't have it?\r Fishing was fun especially for my 8 year old. We had our catch cooked and it was better than the restaurant.\r \r The Pool was nice but apparently uses solar heating and it was over cast so water was cold when we first went in.There was a seminar/convention of some sort whilst we were swimming and was not a welcome \"noise\" .Surely , if we can hear it then the people attending can hear it loud and clear. \r \r Paid to go on a tour of the resort which was ok but was on quite a tight schedule (can probably be longer) to hop off the shuttle, look around and take pictures. \r \r Paid promo rates for the rooms . Won't stay again unless paying promo rates and will bring sandwiches for lunch and a lot of snacks and drinks .Maybe I can sneak in a microwave and bring food (joke!)."

Of course I was nervous at first and wasnt able to look at the view below on my first ride. But you're experience woudnt be complete if you dont take a look at the trees below, the tiny people, and you're co-riders. Haha! If you're a group of eight, you can commission the people in charge to have you take the ride at the same time. Yes, there are eight sky cycle you and your friends can ride at the same time. Perfect for a groufie up above while on a bike. :)\r \r You can also try the indiana jones. Its a cute experience. Brings out the child in you. There are other activities you can try too.

If it's your first time to go to Davao, it is a must to visit this place. The place was very clean and I was really impressed by their restrooms. All restrooms are clean with toilet papers and it doesn't stink. The rates of the activities are reasonable. All the sites are picturesque."

I suggest you get the Vista Cottage if you're traveling as a couple as this provides a romantic feel. The rooms doesn't have AC because they offer the same climate as that of Antipolo and it can get pretty cold at night.\r \r The accommodation comes with a free dinner and breakfast buffet for two so it gives your moneys worth. If you're also up for some adrenalin rush, try Skyswing! you won't be disappointed! haha"

We bought tickets for their shuttle day tour for about 150 pesos I think and it was good for me, I saw for the 1st time a DragonFruit Tree, the gardens were beautiful and I learned a little about how the park used to be an illegal logging site so I felt good that we are contributing in saving the environment because I went there. I haven't stayed in their rooms though so I cannot comment on that but we also had buffet lunch there and the food was not bad but not too good either so it was just ok, I can say that you get what you paid for with this buffet. It was 550 pesos I think. Overall, I recommend everyone to include this place in their itinerary when in Davao City"

Also in the room we check in, they said there was a cable tv but it was not working! The best thing to do here would probably be just a day tour since everything closes at 5."

The scenery was beautiful.The buffet meal that myself, wife and her two parents purchased from the Park Restaurant consisted of a nice variety of Salads,Filipino meals and sweets, as well as various fruit drinks(unlimited).After a short walk around the Bird Avaries we then joined about another 10 visitors for a guided motor tour of the Park area.Our female guide was very helpful, and during the 45 minute tour of the complex we stopped a number of times, where our guide took many photos, amongst the gardens and flowers of the tourists I would recommend a visit to the Park for anyone visiting or living in Davao There are a number of other activities that can be undertaken,but I would suggest prepare for most of the day to enjoy Eden Nature Park."

Nonetheless, we should have tried their different outdoor activities like zipline and biking in a wire, etc. We just take pictures of the outer facade and opt to buy some snacks due to long hours of drive. The food here was a bit pricey so next time you go here, bring your own bottled water/juice to save up."

Got curious so I done some research and decided to go. It is located in Eden Bayabas, Toril. The park sits right at the foot of Mt. Talomo. \r \r The place is perfect for celebrating special occasions because of its relaxing ambiance. The park offers various activities such as zip lining, horse back riding, trekking, fishing, swimming or just simply going around the park to see the beauty of nature. Other must-see places of the park are the Amphitheater, Lola’s Garden, Flower Garden, Plaza Maria, and Mayumi’s well.\r \r I have fear of heights but still I purchased the Combo Ride (Skycycle and Skyrider). After the rides I went to have my lunch at the Vista Restaurant where their served delicious snacks. My tour was at 10:45AM but I was able to finish the ride at 10:54AM. The front desk re-booked mine and put me on the next tour so I just stayed near the front desk until my tour arrives. The tour was really great and since I'm traveling solo the tour guide gladly helped me took my pictures. Its was very great experience and would love to come back. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who will go to Davao. \r \r Keep up the good work guys! God Bless!"

Rode the skycycle - and the guy manning it, Lito, was curt, surly, impatient and downright rude. Some riders were nervous but he didnt care and was very impatient with the nervous ones. In fairness, the guy manning the zipline was a lot nicer. Will not recommend this place unless they make major improvements and train their staff"

First we walked a bit around at the bird park and the butterfly garden where we saw a lot of different spieces beautiful butterflies. We barely met other visitors though the amount of people at the entrance did us think different. \r After some walking around on the upper side of the park, we went for the lunch buffet.\r This was just wow. So yummy, end really everything as much as you wanted to eat. \r Every dish was well prepared, every dessert was yummy. The value for money was just superb.\r After lunch we really had to walk our food a bit off so went went by foot to the lower part of the park where we visited a beautiful flower garden, en some other sightings.\r All the personel was really friendly and helpfull when asking a question.\r I don't know f i would like a longer stay at the park because of it's remote location, but it surely is worth a visit."

Guides are very knowledgeable though and friendly. Our tour guide, Julie, even offers to take your photos and suggests some poses.\r \r Place is clean and well-maintained. Construction is on going on some parts. Did not get to try their sky rider/sky cycle activities due to time sched. They have a playground for kids and also Indiana Jones playground for the young at heart.\r \r Although, we understand that they have limited number of shuttles and they need to go back to use for the succeeding tours, would have given 5stars if the tour stop overs are longer.

We have spent our 3 days in Davao from Manila to go to a wedding and planning where to go after a day is not in our list.. \r \r We had a time where we are thinking if we should go to either Samal Island or in Eden Nature Park but we still ended going to Eden Nature Park because of budget risk too.. It was quite a lot of fun going here, exploring the place and being with my girlfriend.. Trekking is not (yet) one of her likes but after spending the whole day here, we managed to explore almost 90% of the place.. It was fun as if we are also trekking.. The weather is also cooperative as it never rained nor had a scorching heat from the sun.. The day was perfect and everything followed that day.. \r \r We ought to have our trip thru their van but we thought that spending is something that we cannot afford.. So we ended up walking most of the parts in this park and we never had a bad choice as we have explored and again almost 90% of this place.. \r \r You can see the pictures where we have been and ask me questions you might want to ask but ultimately, this is something that you have to go to if you are still young, young at heart and looking for some adventure.. :)"

The parking area was full and the receiving area was jam-packed. The whole place was very crowded. I was pretty amazed. \r \r Anyhow, we paid for lunch buffet (there was a long line) and they said we had to wait. We waited at the children's park down by the restaurant. We can not go anywhere because we did not want to miss the lunch. We waited for like an hour and a half, maybe two hours, until we couldn't wait any longer. Hubby was not complaining but I knew that he was already starving. The waiting pissed me off so I thought to just get my money back and have lunch somewhere else. I talked to one of the busy girls in the receiving area. I was a little mad already but she remained so polite and calm, in fairness, explaining that she couldn't refund the exact amount we paid because we need to pay entrance fee of Php200 something pesos or we can just have the plated snacks. She said snacks are available right away. That somehow consoled me. So, we had plated snacks and got the rest of my money."

I love the story about the owners who patiently waited for 23 years for the trees to grow before officially opening the site for operations. Food though was no good. I was already warned about it but there was no way of getting around it since aside from paying for the shuttle tour, you are required to avail of either a plated snack or buffet lunch. Plated snacks was P220 while the Buffet lunch was P550. Not only was the serving small but it did not taste good too. Not worth the price. I hope they can remove that."

It was a nice place. great if you enjoy the outdoors and nature.\r there is an entry fee to see the park, you can choose either with snacks or with a buffet lunch. I'd suggest the lunch if you are going to make a whole day of it.\r You cna purchase a shuttle bus tour of the place, takes 45 min and takes you to some nice photo shots. Nice, but a bit rushed. You only get 6 min to stop at each of the 3 locations, so you end up running around like crazy taking pics and dont really get to enjoy the views.\r If you are going up for the Zip Line or the new Sky cycle (bicycle way up in the sky on a rope), don't think you have to go to Eden park and pay the entrance fee. The zip line and activities are across the road and separate.\r \r All in all a nice day, we spent about 3-4 hours there and did not get to see it all."

		"Review": "We have been to various attaractions during our stay in Davao and by far this is the best attraction that we have experienced. Eden Gardens is a mountain resort about 3000 feet above sea level spreading over 80 hectares of land. Due to time constraint, we took the guided tour @120p per pax which takes an hour. This guided tour takes you to various points of interest like the Flower garden, Tinubdan (indigenous cultiral heritage of Mindanao, Lola's garden, vegetable garden, fruit tree collection, herbal garden, etc. If you have the time, go on the mountain trail by yourself. Heard it is a friendly yet challenging adventure. We went to theEden sports field which is located across the street from the main entrance. The horse park caters for children and they will love to ride on the horses. The Skyrider (zipline) and the Skycycle (biking on a cable across 200m of line) will provide the youngsters with some fun. Go for the combo Skyrider and Sckcyle @ 300p which saves you 50p if you go chose each adventure separately. We went fishing for Tilapia and Hito thereafter as we heard that the fishes just arrived yesterday. You have to buy what you catch (p210 per kilo) and either take it home have them cooked it. We chose to have our catch cooked there (not too bad for hungry stomachs). It was so easy to catch the fishes as that's what they want you to do. For those who wished to stay overnight, there are mountain villa, cottages and cabins at a price. There is a Vista restaurant which I cannot comment as I did not eat there. The cafe vista provides only snacks but best to bring your own. This place is good for family and friends. Strongly reccomended."

		"Review": "Me and my wife have been to Eden a couple of years ago for a day tour. This time we decided to stay overnight together with our relatives visiting from abroad. Good that the Skycycle and Zipline was added to this place that our younger relatives we're able to enjoy their stay. For non-adventurous like us, we settle for the \"Children's Zipline\". There's also a Fishing Village but when we visited it, it was deserted and good for pictures only. A tip for management; when we visited another country, the village is complemented by a picnic ground where families grilled their catch with an in-house griller. With this approach, the picnic tables become full with so many tourists like us. With this approach, customers may come back again. \r \r We took several Vista cottages. Cottage design is well-suited to it's environs, we loved the veranda. It's good that they well-maintained their bathroom facilities for it's foremost for us. The only drawback of the units are some lights are not operational, outdated wooden floors, and unfitted screen doors and windows for insect protection. For the shuttle tour, for us that have been there before, no excitement, it's the \"same banana\", only the dragon fruits are added into the landscape. We loved the buffet dinner served with generous refills (got several servings of fruits). Sorry for the free buffet breakfast; not a good combination.\r \r Tip: If one's purpose is to do mountain-trekking, go elsewhere for when I check about it last quarter of last year, it's not operational until we came this month, it still was. Also, the swimming pool remains to be in maintenance, hopefully during your visit it becomes operational.\r \r  Tip for day tours: Arrange with your tour operator that you be allowed ample time to use some of the facilities unlike when we first visited, after lunch, the van driver already wants to go back to the city. Or better, rent a private vehicle so you can enjoy or better to stay overnight."

They should change it already as I've read the same thing in the earlier reviews. Beware also of tourist traps. Motorcycles/Tricycles outside the park will overcharge your ride if they know you're a tourist. You can ask assistance from the information area to call for a ride for you with the right price."

The nature lover could go the right side and for those who love exciting activities you would be heading to the left side of the road. But first, you will need to pay the entrance fee, so one way or another you will still need to head at the right side of the road.\r \r The Right Way!\r Feast your eyes with different kinds of flowers in their Flower Garden, wake your senses to the sweet aroma of different herbs and indulge yourself into the majestic view at the top. If you wanted to try fishing they also got this small pond for you, and if ever you got tired and wanted to reward yourself you can always have your fish cooked, of course you will be paying certain amount :). If you are into history, why not explore the cultures of the Southern Philippines, in here they have a place called Tinubdan where guest are given the privilege to take a glimpse of lumad life. And for those who want to take an adventure they have a Mountain Trail, which is a 4 hours hike.\r \r Why Not Go Left?\r This side of the road is where you can have fun. I mean it! They have an obstacle course called Indiana Jones, where you can race with your friends. Also if wanna make it count, you can try their 200 meter long skyrider (zipline) and skycycle (bicycle riding in the air) while enjoying the view of Davao City and its Gulf. And if you are not into great excitement, you can engage into horse-back riding.\r \r Access.\r *A day tour would only cost 200 pesos, where in a cab will take you to different parts of the resort, this also includes snacks serve after the tour (bet you will like their pasta!).\r *If you are into overnight staying they have cabins and lodges.\r \r It is my first time to explore Davao, and this one makes it to my list."

We got several gardening ideas during this visit and applied it once we got home.\r \r The tour was short as usual, quite pricey if you come to think of it (almost Php 200/head) - and this is on top of the entrace fee that you paid for. The buffet was so-so, but definitely better than the snacks (don't even bother considering it). I also do not suggest that you bring your own food, unless you're here for overnight - bringing own food for cooking contradicts the idea of relaxation in this huge nature park.\r \r Considering the distance from the city center, I don't suggest this to be a destination for overnight. It's great if you're a tourist who seldoms visit Davao but for the local folks, it's not really worth it in my opinion.\r \r Make sure you check out all the places you can visit in this park. While the other spots don't have guides, it's fun to just walk around and check out their facilities. You might find something that tickles your interest like zip line, sky cycle, fishing, etc. Oh, don't forget to bring your selfie stick."

It would also be best if you know what to do in the park before going there to save time. Otherwise, you might miss the guided tour and end up not maximizing your travel time. In our case, our primary purpose is the guided tour and the skycycle.\r \r Directions from downtown to the park: Take the jeepney going to Toril. Fare is 40php. Let the driver know that you are going to Eden Nature Park. He will drop you off in front of Mercury Drug store in Toril where habal habals and tricycles going to Eden are parked. Tricycle charged us 250php one-way for the entire trike. We thought it was a bit pricey but we had no choice, it was too hot at 10am so we opted for tricycle over habal habal. Going back, we took habal habal and the fare is only 50php. But I won't recommend it, it was way too hot I got sunburnt.\r \r Guided Tour: We arrived just in time for the scheduled tour at 10:45am. Guided tour is 120php and time allotted is 1 hour. To be honest, I was not expecting anything from the tour but I ended up enjoying it. Lots of things to see around the park!\r \r We also got the plated snack for 200php (pasta,bread, small cupcake and a glass of soda). We visited the fishing village for picture taking only but you can fish and you can have it/them cooked. There are cottages inside so you can have your lunch here.\r \r Skycyle. The area for zipline and skycyle is outside the park. You will have to cross the other side of the street, outside the gate of the park. Skycycle is 200php but if you want to do skycycle and zipline, you are only charged 300php for both. \r \r Am not gonna lie, skycycle is scary as hell! It's 60 feet high and going up is torture in itself especially for someone like me who has fear of heights. Once on top and you have mustered the courage to ride, remember that you will have to skycyle your way to the other station and back (roundtrip). I recommend you really do bike your way because if you get scared in the middle of the wire, you'll be stuck. It's worth a try! The more you pedal, the faster you'll get it done. We finished roundtrip in under 5 minutes. Don't look down, look at the grand view of downtown Davao instead! :D\r \r Indiana Jones ride is also fun. There weren't many guests our age who visited the park that time so my friend and I monopolized the Indiana Jones ride. It was so fun we were screaming that mostly older guests had fun looking at us. (That or maybe they were annoyed we're being noisy. LOL)\r \r Definitely worth the trip and skycycle is definitely the best experience!"

We've been there a couple of times in the past but this was the first time we went there without the kids. We stayed overnight and rented the Vista Cottage 1. The rate was P3,220 which already included a Valentine dinner and breakfast. The Valentine dinner was far from romantic – way too many people and the tables were closely arranged it was really crowded. The acoustic band was okay but the singers did not even dress up for the occasion. Ahh, so much for my romantic dinner expectations, lol.\r \r Anyway, here’s what I can say about the place:\r \r The cottage/room: \r The Vista cottage is awesome. You sleep to the relaxing sounds of crickets and river water running, and you wake up to the sound of birds chirping. So lovely. The room has no aircon unit (who needs one when it's really cold there!), it has firm beds (Vista 1 has twin bed), soft pillows and very clean, sweet smelling linen. It has a mini ref with two small bottles of complimentary water, an electric kettle with complimentary instant coffee and cream, and a small TV set (but lousy cable stations). It also has a wide dresser with equally wide mirror and a veranda overlooking the lush green trees. Vista 1 is situated on a hill and the veranda is really cozy. There is a sliding door that separates the room from the veranda. You may leave the door open at night without worrying about insects and mosquitoes because the veranda is fully screened. By the way, there's no wifi in the room, only in the reception lobby which I haven't tried it so I don't know if it works. Cellular phone signals are good, for Sun and Globe networks, that is.\r \r The bathroom:\r It is very spacious and clean with hot (really hot!) and cold (really cold!) shower, clean and soft towels, toiletries that include rolls of toilet paper, dental kits, shampoo and soap. \r There is no hair dryer but no big deal, really.\r \r The food: Dinner was okay and buffet breakfast was nothing special (hey, no brewed coffee!). Expect fresh, organically grown veggies in the food menu. I'm sure you'll love their fresh lettuce, arugula and mizuna. You may have your meals sent to your room but make sure to order hours ahead.\r \r The staff: I have only good words for the staff - from the booking staff, to the reception staff to the housekeeping and restaurant staff. They are all friendly and very courteous.\r \r Eden is not easily accessible by public transportation. You may go there via private car, rented car or a taxi. They also have cottages and dormitories for big groups. The place is huge but you can explore it in one day. I suggest you join the day tour and be enthralled by the beautiful flower garden and amphitheater, the organic farm where they grow herbs and lettuce (mostly), the aviary (though small), the nicely designed swimming pool (very cold water, by the way), and the fishing village (catch a fish, pay and have it cooked). For additional fun, you can avail of their zip line ride, horseback riding or let the child in you enjoy the playground. \r \r Overall, I find Eden Nature Park a very pleasant and relaxing place to stay. It’s not cheap, though. If they don’t say it’s free, then most likely, it’s not :)"

Like purslane (olasiman), kulitis, ... Maybe one day, we can buy luxury stuffs anywhere, but those plants aren't easy to find. Just a little bit pity in my heart.\r \r The birds and animals are nice. Include heron and peacock. I saw a peacock was walking around and I said: you even are more beautiful than me. I saw the animals in cages and thought: \"It looks like you are in \"prison\". But I am actually also in a prison. It's just my prison is bigger than yours. Because I can't be with you\".\r \r Then I think life is just needed to be like that. Living in nature. Self provide organic products. Peaceful and stress-free.\r \r I ate a pomelo at a fruit vendor outside, just p10 per kilo.\r \r The horseback riding, skyrider, skycycle fulfilled my wishes. With a little nervous, worry, but the feeling was GREAT. The staffs there helped me and other riders take pictures and return the phones by dropping in a bag, so no one need to walk upstair to take the phone.\r \r NOTICE that the horseback riding, skyriding area just operate on 1-4pm in a separate place. So if you don't wish to pay entrance fee (with food), you can go there directly on the afternoon."

Some of the family went zip-lining (flying fox) and my niece went horse riding. Horse riding is not like other places I have visited as only one horse and a guide sits with you. I think this could be improved. Also a warning, these activities are an additional charge. There were some free small zip lines here which were fun for all. On to lunch - this was excellent. Soup, mains and dessert. Unlimited drinks. The service here was great and the staff did a great job. We then did the tour of this 80 hectare property which in all honesty is a marketing tool for their accommodation. Our guide however was excellent and informative."

So plan a whole day for it.\r The resort has beautiful gardens, the trees are named, so I know now whats a Mangotree and whats a Mangosteentree.\r Lots to do in the resort, like a fishing village, where you can catch your own fish and cook it afterwards.\r But the really exciting thing to do is the mountain trail. Be prepared: good shoes, long trousers, long sleeves.\r This trail takes you for 4 hours through the jungle (4km), you always mind your steps not stepping on a snake, or meet behind the leaves a big spider. It was my adventure in Mindanao. Not really scarry, it is watched. \r Snacks are not recommended, pay for the menu."

Experience adventure as you trek the mountain trail, rope gliding in Indiana Jones and zipped in at Sky Rider and a lot more. Nature makes me feel real good."

My last visit with my wife a couple of days ago turned out to be a disappointment as the place has shown significant deterioration. I observed that only the beddings were changed and toiletries provided. However, the veranda that should be the cottage's big feature was not cleared of a lot of dead insects and poo most likely from lizards. These dung were also spread on the table inside. When I gave the feedback to the gal at the check out counter, she only said that the rooms are usually cleaned up before they take in guests. I hope she would follow through with what she said that she will let the management know about it. Services at the dining hall were fine. I even got 2 cups of brewed coffe. I suggest that would be guests request that their rooms be really clean."

		"Review": "Eden Nature Park resort is an icon when you visit Davao City. It has been a tourist attraction for quite a while and for me it is the best place to unwind and appreciate nature. Even though there are a number of nature parks that you can find in Davao City since its a \"green city\", you need to visit Eden for a number of reasons;\r 1. nature in its beauty - the area is wonderfully located in the mountainous region of the city and the weather is cold and even foggy at times. \r 2. food - at affordable prices, you can taste their buffer that are organically grown. The salad is one of my favorites.\r 3. cleanliness - the area is well-maintained. The area is clean and garbage bins are properly disposed of.\r 4. staff - the staff are courteous and honest. I left my jacket in the restaurant area and it took me an hour after to get it (because of the tour) and they gladly returned it to me with a smile.\r 5. the rooms - there are a variety of rooms to choose from both for the budget-conscious and the extravagant. \r 6. activities - there will never be a dull moment in your stay there. there are a hefty number of activities you could choose from (free or with a fee). \r \r \r tip: better stay at this park in just a day or two to fully appreciate the amenities. If it's expensive for you, just book a room on their off-peak (june to august). They offer at 50% discounts. You'll never regret your stay if you want to relax and enjoy nature at its best."

Kadayawan festivities during the month of August, is a unique home-grown event among Davaoenos that continues to attract both local and foreign interests. Throwback 2013. I had the pleasure of celebrating this month-long merriment of abundance and harvest with some good 'ole friends from the past.\r \r The friendly commute means of Davao to Toril would take you high above the city heights towards a hill where there are beautiful sceneries wherein you can unwind, relax, play and reflect. Eden Nature Park, for me is such a classy, underrated yet comparable to all other famous parks of the world. It should be there in anyone's itinerary when in Davao!\r \r And what's even more facininating about the park is that, it is 95% man-made, and continues to be a major haul of the region's premiere crops like pomelos, mangosteen and the \"drurian\" of various kinds. Whatever entertainment you have in mind, be it a wedding, a reunion, an outdoor overload, or a simply a full-day of environmental tour, Eden can literally transform your stay to something paradise. And that's a promise! ;-)"

The tour ends with a merienda that is packaged with it.\r \r Fresh clean air is most enjoyable at the park, where a wide variety of flowers and fruit trees are planted, along with vegetables and herbs. Macadamia trees abound too. Large stands of pine trees spread across the park provide an invigorating scent of pine, which travellers won't experience anymore in most places in Baguio. A butterfly farm and museum is accessible near the main entrance. \r \r Hiking trails along forested areas were pointed out during the tour. These are ideal for guests who stay several days in accomodation facilities. At various spots, there are replicas of tribal houses. In one village, a short cultural show was performed.\r \r Capturing the beauty of nature in this park, for the appreciation of a greater number of people, is one legacy of Eden's founder Mrs Fe Ayala whose vision is hopefully pursued with continuing determination by those who have stepped into her big shoes.\r \r A holiday trip in Davao is enriched with a tour of Eden."

I had to go back four times just get food. In the end, I felt I didn't get my money's worth. My advise, book a guided tour if you want one but the tour was boring for me, not worth the one hour travel to get there. The fishing village is just to let the kids try out fishing because you are really fishing in a fish pond full of fishes! You pay entrance, pay for the overpriced fishes that you catch. "

The weather was perfect with a slight drizzle making it feel like you are in an airconditioned world. Part of the place has been planted to the now cancer treating fruits, the mangosteen. Travelers love the place for it is one of the first \" developed\" mountains that has been converted to a beautiful tourist spot. I visited the place with 9 other giggly principals who are extremely inspired by the beauty and serenity of a man's vision to share his wealth and his love for nature. It took ten years (and lots of money and precious time) to conquer and preserve the gigantic mountain. Tiny falls and pools of fresh water still provide the much needed water for the vegetation. \r \r Be very early when going there for it is usually full of admirers/adventurers. The line for the mini bus is long but while waiting you can go around and visit the gardens and other nearby beautiful places. They can give you a tentative hour to come back since they have everything grouped and timed. We should have stayed the whole day..unfortunately my friends wanted to go to the market to buy mangosteens, chocolate A and cashews.

		"Review": "1 1/2 days will do at this place (one overnight). Things to do:\r \r - fish at the fishing village and they'll cook your catch for you. Turns out cheaper than eating at the restaurant. Do this for at least 1 lunch.\r - always some good food at the restaurant buffet. It does constitute a \"hidden cost\" of P350 per person (given that you probably won't be able to find food anywhere else near unless you live in a cottage and you brought your own)\r - the mountain trail isn't picturesque but is interesting nonetheless. Hanging bridge at 250 m, Vanilla loop at 1.6 km and Lola's garden at 2.8 km make it worth the 4 km trek. Bring water and find a good walking stick along the way, especially if it had rained the previous day.\r - zip line has a great view of Davao Gulf. Do the cycle zip if you want a really good view because you can control how fast you go. Lola's Garden has another good view and few people go there so it's quiet (problem is, you'll end up walking a distance back to where you came from because I didn't see any phones or attendants in the area)\r - butterfly garden, aviary, and playground good place to bring kids\r - breathe in fresh mountain air. No aircon needed at night. (this was January though) but can get hot during the day\r \r It's more than an hour from downtown. It's an uphill ride so the vehicle won't get past 2nd gear. The trip downhill is faster. 1 hour straight to the airport, (You can stop over at the Japanese Tunnel on the way to the airport) The staff were helpful. Just don't email them. They don't reply or reply late."

Pillow hard as a baseball bat, rooms in need of a renovation and so are the common toilets. Showers ok.\r The cottages and other overnight facilities maybe better but would not know, although they seem popular with families and groups.\r \r Beautiful surroundings with a nature trail where you pass through rainforest and the various parts of the park. A couple of big trees had tumbled down and damaged part of the trail but with some effort and crawling you will get through. This is being fixed.\r The park is Overlooking Davao from abt 700 Meter Above Sea Level. Cool and fresh with forest of pinetrees, well kept good birdpark and butterfly park area. There were few visitors during the weekdays I was there so the personnel gave good briefings on what they had of insects,birds etc.\r Enjoyable and educational.\r Food. \r They have in addition to the flower parks also extensive salad/vegetable growing areas and their food and especially the salads were superb.\r Overall I enjoyed my stay ande it is well worth a trip."

The place is refreshing, great for children, the food is delicious, they grow their own organic vegetable for the restaurant. The price is just fine for delicious and fresh buffet. The staff is super polite and nice. If there are foreigners on the shuttle ride around the park, they'll speak English so don't worry!\r \r You can buy plants from the green house if you fancy. I lived in Davao for a year so I got some herbs back home to grow and they do grow very strongly. \r \r For those who like Asian adventure on motorbikes, you can easily get here like a local: from the city center, C.M Recto street, however, this is the new name of the street, the name on the jeepney would be Claveria; On this street, you can take the jeepney that says \"Toril\" This jeepney will take you along Mc.Arthur Highway all the way to Toril district. Let the driver know in advance that you are going to Eden Nature Park, it's very well-known among the locals, so when it's time to get off, he'll let you know. Do not get nervous or pissed off if the driver doesn't respond to you in a proper way; they themselves are nervous when they have to communicate in English, trust me, they do want to be helpful. However, keep your eyes on the road after around 20-30 minutes after you get on the jeepney, you'll see a sign that tells you that you are arriving at the intersection where you have to turn right and go up hill to Eden. If I remember it right, it's only about 20 PhP for the jeepney fare. Get off at the intersection and ask for a motorbike ride. If you're not so big, they can ride 2 of you on one bike and it would be 100 PhP each way. Otherwise, each of you get on a motorbike and it's also 100 PhP each way for each of you. Well, in general, 100 PhP/per motorbike regardless how many people. It's very inexpensive considering the 12-kilometer distance ahead and it's uphill. When you're already there, the driver will wait for you to take you back if you come back the same day. If you stay the night, just take their phone number and call them half an hour ahead of when you want to go back. If they wait for you, just be nice and generous to give them a little more money when they take you back to the city, 50 PhP will do just fine. \r I love the place and take everyone here who came visit me in Davao =))"

You'd have a guided tour and appreciate the place more. They have a zip line and worth trying. One may opt to go fishing and have your prize cooked there and enjoy it.

		"Review": "Eden Nature Park is a wonderful place, even if the rooms are spartan. I think the reason why the amenities in the rooms are sparse is because it is trying to position itself as a \"Green\" Resort, therefore there are no air conditioners, and their television sets are not up-to-date. After all, you want to go there to be one with nature, and not to stay in your room to watch TV. The food is healthy, as they grow their own organic vegetables. We particularly enjoyed the fishing (it was easy because they stock up their pond regularly with Tilapia), and eating-what-we-caught, experience. They wrapped our fish in banana leaves and deep fried it. It was so good! Also, the operations manager, Celia, took care of us very well. We wish we spent more time in the place. The next time we visit, we intend to bring our hiking boots and will do a lot of hiking. "

		"Review": "In my recent trip to Davao last month on a business planning session with officemates, we took a guided tour to this place. It is about 45mins - 1hr from Davao City proper and it is their version of Baguio City, i.e. a tourist attraction perched on top of a hill, zigzag roads, cool and sunny weather, pine trees and a cultural performance from a local minority tribe. In fact, you wouldn't imagine that you are in Davao if you visit this place because it will remind you perfectly of Baguio City. There are three areas here for picture taking. Once you take the shuttle ride, it will stop at those 3 areas, i.e. the rainbow garden and the minority village are two of those places. This is something totally different and unexpected from Davao City. Fresh like a scent of pine trees indeed."

		"Review": "If you are looking for a place to relax with family or friends, you've got to visit this place. This is accessible both by public and private commute. We highly recommend that you go to this place by public commute for more adventure and fun.\r \r How: From the airport, you take a jeepney going to Abreeza Mall. Go to the information counter and ask how to take a jeepney going to Toril. When you reach Toril, take the habal-habal going to the resort.\r \r *The public commute is a lot cheaper than hiring a cab.\r \r When staying at this place, it is best to book in advance. You may opt to choose to stay overnight. As for my experience, my friend and I stayed for one night only and was not able to experience everything. We should have stayed longer, like to 2 to 3 days more.\r \r There are plenty of activities to do:\r \r 1. Check out the amphitheater where a lot of beautiful flowers could be found. There you could also see the rainbow structure. You will definitely have a lot of pictures taken here.\r 2. You can go trekking. You can try their mountain trail.\r 3. You can go swimming.\r 4. You can go fishing and have your catch cooked. This is for your yummy lunch.\r 5. Try the zipline. This is to experience something exhilarating.\r 6. Their Indiana Jones ride is worth the try. :-)\r \r Aside from that, there are a lot of cottages to choose from. This depends of the number of people checking in. You can check their website for this.\r \r Of course, you should not forget the food. During our stay we had buffet dinner and breakfast. The food is so satisfying. :-)"

Front desk people were not very helpful in resolving the issue, did not even try to do a refund of the excess payment and just told me to gorge myself with food at the restaurant or to buy toursit-y souvenir items (which I don't really need since I'm from Davao) to consume the excess payment. Very bad customer service. The restaurant crew was very pleasant though, maybe because I was at the restaurant A LOT.

It’s quiet and serene and all one hears are the birds chirping (besides for all the visitors of course). \r \r The owners have done a good job restoring the place and its defiantly worthwhile visiting. Guests/visitors are taken on a guided tour on an open air golf buggy type of car. The guide spoke an excellent English. The only downside is she was always promoting and talking about their cottages and rooms which one can rent etc…. in fact it got quite annoying as she always managed to bring it up during the 45 minute tour. Personally I would never stay here as the accomadation is very basic, no luxuries and no air conditioning. Well I must say the climate here is nice and cool and perhaps air con is not needed.\r \r They have swimming and fishing as extras and also lunch.\r \r They have a beautiful aviary which I enjoyed. \r \r I would sum up and say this was my best day trip from Davao.\r Enjoy my pics!"

Check in was quick and we were asked to book meals ahead of time. \r \r the room was sufficient. nothing impressive except that it was SPACIOUS it had 4 single beds that we pushed together to make 1 (gigantic) bed. a couple of concerns though,\r i would have preferred and slept better if we had 2 king sized beds as opposed to the singles since the kids sleep in our bed too but that is not an option here. room size is ideal for families with teenagers as it can still accommodate 2 more extra beds. but for families with young children, a king sized bed would really, really be appreciated. I barely slept as I felt so uncomfortable and at some point in the evening, i got really sweaty. there's no AC btw. they rely on the cold mountain weather to keep guests cool.\r the t&b was spacious as well with hot and cold shower and strong water pressure. you'd have to bring your toiletries though. they only provide tiny rectangles of soap and 4 sachets of shampoo. \r \r so why give it 4 stars? because the dinner buffet was very good. the filipino fare served was delicious ( fried chicken, pancit sotanghon, siomai and bistek tagalog) plus, there was a salad bar with freshly picked tomatoes, carrots and lettuce. all for only P350 per person.\r \r also, there's so much to do. for the kids there's the play ground and horse back riding and for the more adventurous, the indiana jones and more extreme zip line. the tour is also worth mentioning as we had the most photo ops there.\r \r i think there's more to do here but we just did not have enough time. we will definitely be going back to find out."

I strongly objected to this as I felt that I should have been informed when I booked that the room was next to a seminar. After another lengthy phone call they agreed to give us an upgrade to a holiday lodge at no extra cost, the lodge was excellent and I strongly recommend that you go for this. The meals at Eden seem to be average but unless you get there when the doors open you will be dissapointed at the choices left as they don't seem to replenish the buffet, when it's gone it's gone.

		"Review": "Went to Eden on a day trip and only stayed 2 hours. The tour of the property which takes approx 1 hour was great and the guide was excellent. The mosquitos were really bad so make sure you take repellent and cover up. The flower garden was nice but this was the extent of what I enjoyed. The zipline which was the main purpose of my visit was closed which was disappointing and we were advised of it when booking in. We then thought we would try the fishing village which you have to pay additional for which is fine. Then when arriving there I am advised that you also have to pay for anything you catch even if you don't want to keep it. To me this just seems unreasonable because you are paying twice and when I booked the trip I was told I could catch and release as we were flying out first thing in morning so didn't want to keep anything. \r \r Anyway this just turned me off and so we left and went to the Philippine Eagle Park which was amazing!"

He takes good pictures, and will always prioritize taking pictures of us before the other guests. And for an extra adventure, ride a payong or habal habal when going there instead of a taxi. :)"

When we arrived we went in this cute cottage, as the reception. We then payed for the package and after waiting for around 30 minutes we were able to hop on the tour. It was really a very well executed tour in this nature paradise! The tall trees, the mist and the breeze by the forest was really calming. Herbs and beautiful flowers at time envelop the side of the path. The view at one point is breathtaking! Also, there were stops that showcased the history of Davao, such as the different tribes in the area. Also, interesting fruit bearing trees such as Marang, Mangosteen, Durian and even Macadamia Nut trees are found in one of the plantations. After the tour we went on to have snacks in a garden set-up which continued the calm atmosphere of the place as we dined (it even has a free wi-fi connection). It was really a great experience with nature, and a must when going to Davao!"

When you arrive at the area, one would be mistaken that they were not in the Philippines. The climate is cool, fresh air and the facilities are of some standard. If you like to go hiking and trekking, this is one of the best places to go to if you are in Davao City. \r \r You do not have to travel so far to experience the beauty of nature nor suffer so much in the traveling part. Its best if you have your own private vehicle to get there, because taking public transport to Eden is just simply impossible. I enjoyed the trails that they had around the Park because its high up, and with the freshness and coolness of the area, you don't get tired easily in usually such a humid country. With great views of Davao City from certain areas, this park is not a place to be missed!"

Nature is really beautiful especially when untouched. I felt like i'm lost in a jungle full of fruits, trees and flowers. before going to the restaurant for lunch, our last stop was almost at the top of the mountain, giving us a birds eye view of Davao city. Breathtaking is all i can say. Lunch was served buffet style. :) there is also a zipline on the other side of the park. It was my first try and i felt all my blood drained from my face but it was worth it. please do not ever skip going here when you are in davao."

There are also rides to enjoy in place like zipline or kayak in the fishing area. They also have rooms for over night stay.

Pinoy lunch buffet (450P) or Snack (120P), including soft drinks such unspeakable.\r Plus a round trip - by all Pinoys and 80% of the other passengers - booked. Ate and I are of course tempered hikers so we gave up the tour. The dashed line is the trail. Supposedly 6 km long. However, you forgot the highs and lows well. Of course you can stay there at relatively high prices. The walker leaves the course effeminate bus passengers back in the InfoCenter.\r  These have a good time there anyway. You can go fishing where the fish is considerably more expensive than the market. In addition to there is a \"Pinoy Model\" village from non-food material, a kind of cable car, etc. However, I was come to walk. The trail is rugged and increasingly steeper. The hikers reached after about two hours a hill. From this point of view in good weather you have to Samal and beyond. There is anything built on what vegetables you want lettuce, arugula, tomatoes, etc. The tourists are offered by the raised beds culinary herbs (rosemary, coriander, Basil, celery, etc.) to sniff and taste. Disgusted by the healthy, the observed Pinoys throw the stuff away again immediately. Is not she lovely, is not greasy and not smelling like old fish, they can not use. Arrived back at the information center you can order the yummy stuff from the field as a salad. Tastes and is inexpensive."

For 470 pesos or approximately US10.00, one can eat the buffet lunch consisting of dishes made of organic ingredients grown at the Eden Nature Park. Salad greens are very fresh and delicious. The same is true with the meat dishes, fresh cut-up fruits and other desserts. Those prefering light lunch, they can have sandwiches for a cheaper price..\r \r Relax, and watch the views of Davao City from the distance. The Park is located at the hilly parts of the city (80 hectares) and with many trees and plants surrounding it, the weather is cool and comfortable. . \r \r Note: Without your own transportation, it is difficult to reach this Park and other tourist spots of Davao City. Consider paying between 2500 -3000 Philippine pesos for a car, taxi, or van that can accommodate 1-6 passengers to visit the Eden Nature Park and other tourist spots."

		"Review": "Eden Nature Park???\r \r At first i actually have no idea about this place but most of the\r people around me talked about it..I was zoo courious about this place\r and zoo i look at it at the google map and see it for myself..\r We went there together with my fiancé and since he wants to try\r Pilipino style instead of riding on a taxi we decided to ride on a\r jeepney (with signage TORIL) though its hassle\r  cuz its kinda hot and its a long ride (cheap thou its cost 14-20. 00)\r ..if I'm not mistaken that ride took 45 minutes from downtown to TORIL\r .We told the driver to take us off to the market ( TORIL PROPER) where\r we can get another ride from motorcycle which cost at least 150.00 all\r in all for the 2 of us and the ride took another 30 minutes i\r guess?..Just be careful and be wise cuz if the driver know that your\r not a Davao residence they will make the price higher so take this\r advice \"always asked those people around before you ride in\"\r \r By the way if you take TAXI? it would take at least 30-40 minutes from\r down town to TORIL / EDEN PARK...some part of the road going to EDEN\r PARK was rocky soo it kinda rough and hassle to go to EDEN by\r motorcycle..\r \r More or less after 1 hr? when we got there yoou will see their front\r desk and they will great you/approach you and they will ask you to pay\r 300+ (for entrance fee and snack only with tour guide or if you don't\r want to avail the tour guide then you might pay lesser) and for buffet\r lunch and with tour guide you will need to pay 400+ including entrance\r fee. Actually the buffet lunch is available till 1:00pm if I'm not\r mistaken.ABout their snacks they only have few choices for their\r visitors and i admit i don't like their snacks cuz its plated but but\r but but,... i LOVE their buffet lunch its zoo cool most are fresh\r nutritious. They actually have vegetable farm inside their park zoo\r their menu are always fresh and you will know what i mean once you try\r it..I love it and i would love to go back their again soon..I was\r kinda sad cuz i dent get a chance to try their \"FISH VILLAGE\" ..as far\r as i can remember the Entrance fee to their fish village was 200 per\r head and you can take with you the fish that you will catch or you can\r ask them to cook it for you..They will give you material u need on\r catching fish ;)\r \r And you guys should try their Nature Tour cuz they have a lot of good stuff to discover..(from plant) they have different kinds of flowers,trees,fruits,vegetable etc. and anyway the last time that i was there \" i saw some horse\" ( i love horse..dont know how to ride them though).hope they have a riding horse :) soon cuz i would love to try ...but on the ZIP LINE part witch is 100 meters away i guess from that park ..they have horse riding ... \r \r AND ofcourse in the end of the day you don't need to worry about\r getting a ride cuz there is a motorcycle waiting for you out side the\r entrance gate..I remember before the guard told me that we don't get\r any ride and the only way for us to get back into the city was to take\r that TAXI who was parked at the street..and too late for us to realize\r that the guard fooled as ..we notice that there is a motor waiting out\r side..and zoo the 2nd time we went there i know what to do and don't\r listen to that stupid guard anymore :) and for your information guys?\r the driver ask as to pay 1600.00 with is too much..soo best advice\r always check the meter before riding on a taxi ;)\r \r We didn't ask for meter anyway..ahahha no wonder why we surprised \r \r Hope you guys enjoy your visit ;)"

		"Review": "Almost 1.5 hours road trip from our hotel at North Zen and 3,000 feet above sea level, you will find Eden Nature Park. Eden is still part of Davao City. If you love nature, then you will definitely enjoy a trip to EDEN. Going around Eden is simple by renting a shuttle service. I enjoyed the Hydroponics since I have this type of system installed in my house. Here you can see different variety of plants, veggies, herbs, fruits, etc. You also offer overnight stay in EDEN and you may choose from different rooms or villas. Never leave Davao without paying a visit to EDEN.\r \r Pros: Lovely view and scenery, fresh air and a lot of activities available.\r \r Cons: Make sure that the van you rent is bnew and able to climb steep roads. Budget going here is not on the cheap side. Check pricing on their website."

		"Review": "We had our trip booked at Matina Town Square (MTS) day before our desired schedule. We were shown the price list and minutes after we paid for the reservation. We had it scheduled for 10 in the morning. When we arrived at the venue, we got there late. Upon arriving we were asked by the guard on duty if we have reservations made and we were then given a laminated sheet to submit to the front desk. At the front desk, we weren't told that we're late or anything. Turns out we got there early for the reserved buffet lunch. The lady at the front desk asked us if we wanted to join the guided tour, which we thought was included in the buffet lunch. We had the reservation explained and it turned out we we're not booked for the guided tour as the guy in the MTS office told us. So we paid additional to join the tour and were just squeezed in like regular walk-in guests. Well, that's okay. We could've verified that at the MTS office.\r \r So while waiting for the guided tour at 1PM. we went first to the Indiana Jones grounds. It's a nice starter for those who would want to try zip lining but are afraid to try the real thing. Simply, Indiana Jones is a miniature zip line wherein you would help yourself out in gliding through the zips. We enjoyed it a lot!\r \r After that, we went to the Skyrider. As I can remember, it's a 400-meter long, 60-meter high two-way zip line. You'd need to pay extra for this. Also, you'd need to sign the waiver before engaging the zip. If you're a minor, you would need your parents' consent. So we got the harness ready and we're ready to zip. It was enjoyable! The tiring part is the climbing the staircase all the way to the top. The people there are courteous and accommodating.\r \r We went back for the buffet lunch and it was okay. They served 4-6 courses of food together with a free glass of softdrinks. For me, it was okay. What's nice is the salad. The vegetables are fresh as can be. It's like they were freshly harvested.\r \r Then off we go to the guided tour. Your registered names will be called one by one as you get assigned to multi-cabs. You'll have one tourist guide who will explain the sites at the park. They also have this recorded voice over that would help you appreciate the view more. We learned a lot from this experience. The three stops were great! Our tour guide, Sarah, whom we call Anna, for fun, was friendly, knowledgeable and approachable, not to mention, jolly. She took most of our pictures and she explained questions that we have about the park.\r \r After the 45-minute guided tour, we're just left visiting the Family Trail wherein they have lots of bird and other animals. Then we visited the souvenir shop.\r \r We enjoyed our stay at Eden Nature Park! Maybe next time, we'll stay there overnight or try the mountain trail. Whew!"

		"ReviewTitle": "Relaxing amidst nature",
		"Review": "For visitors to Davao, one usually recommended place to visit is the Eden Nature Park and Resort. Although it’s just a little more than an hour away, it’s way out of the city and few taxis will venture there on a metered fare basis and will usually negotiate a fixed rate which effectively translates to a round-trip fare.\r \r For overnighters, check-in time is 2:00 PM. Full pre-payment is required upon reservation (via bank deposit); and during check-in, another P1000 is paid as a refundable deposit. We ventured first to the Fishing Village, where one is allowed to fish-all-you-can (mostly tilapia), provided you pay for all the fishes caught, and have them either grilled and steamed for consumption in any one of the huts surrounding the lagoon. Spaghetti, bottled water and soft drinks are also sold here. There were a lot of peacocks freely running around, as well as several pigeons in the open.\r \r It started to rain after lunch, so we took the shuttle back to our cabin. The Camella room has four standard beds but has enough space for two extra beds. The room was spacious but basic; aside from the beds, there was a small TV showing local channels, a cabinet, small coffee table and two chairs, a small refrigerator and a writing table. There was complimentary bottled water and coffee. There was no air-conditioner but an electric fan was provided. \r \r Their lone restaurant Vista serves buffet lunch/breakfast/dinner. For lunch and dinner, there were about 5 dishes, salad (with vegetables harvested from their own farm within the park), soup and dessert. Our room package included breakfast and dinner. The rooms were quite spread out in the resort, and although our room was reachable by a 10-minute walk, the rains made the roads and pathways muddy. A shuttle service is available for guests to bring them to their rooms (free for certain type of rooms; with charge for others).\r \r One can take the guided shuttle tour (for a minimal additional fee) which goes around the park showing various fruit trees, hydrophonic vegetable farms, herb gardens, flower gardens, a tribal village, among others. The guide was knowledgeable and very accommodating. Along the way there were three 5-minute stops for photo-taking. \r \r There was a swimming pool and a smaller kiddie pool located at the edge of the resort, with a nice view of the Davao Gulf. At the time we were there, only few guests availed of the pool, probably because this was a bit of a distance from most of the rooms. \r A popular attraction was the Sky-rider, their version of the zip-line. Other activities include horseback riding and mountain trail hiking. There were also mini zip lines (where your feet are just only about two feet from the ground). There is also a small playground and obstacle course, and a floral/plant shop. \r \r A sour note occurred at the end of our stay, or more particularly after we’ve already gone back home. We were supposed to receive a refund, but the counter clerk said that since this was already fully paid via bank deposit and an OR issued, they cannot give the refund immediately but will deposit the amount back to our account. To this day, more than four months after our stay, no refund ever came and when I called a couple of times earlier to follow up, I was given the runaround.\r \r Overall, this is a nice change of scenery when one wants to relax in nature other than the usual beach getaway."

I will say dont try the mountain trail if you are out of shape because its not so easy and wear shoes with really good soles. The restaurant could have been a little better but everything we did eat there was really good. You really should experience it if you are in Davao."

		"Review": "Eden Nature Park - is a man-made attraction nestled 3,000 feet above sea level. It is an 80-hectare paradise with lots of pine trees, facilities, accommodations and attractions.\r We spent a great day here with a guided tour by bus, thanks to our pretty and very cooperative tour guide, Emilee Timbreza, all the places, plants, trees, etc. were described to us. The children enjoyed the adventure playground and some of the adults did too! including us, of course!\r Going up at Eden, there’s a gate before the main office/lobby of Eden where you can buy the ticket for the tours. At the entrance, is another 10 min drive going up. We took the day tour, Snack package, which consists of a guided tour to the whole park, and a sandwich, chicharon, mini cupcake and glass of soft drinks as the snack. The guided tour plus the plated snack cost us 320 pesos each.\r The tour of the place is more of an ‘agricultural’ tour, the place had some interesting plants and flowers around. On the tour, there would be stops so we can take pictures of the area, or often times, get a chance to pick plants around the farms. The tour takes about 45 to 1 hour, depending on how ‘makulit’ our co-tourists are. In our case, since we are quite a big group, we’re the ones that’s always taking too long during tour stops. hehehe. The destination at the end of the tour is the canteen of Eden park. This is where they’d give you your food. They serve the food in buffets, which we didn't avail since we’re pressed of time (going back to Manila at 3pm). So instead of having lunch, we did avail of the plated snack"

The hiking trails must have been superb when they were first built, but some places are a little overgrown now. The whole place is a bit of a work in progress, although it's hard to imagine it completely finished.\r \r They offer cottages and cabins and campsites. The restaurant was more than adequate. There's a large swimming pool and a zip line ride among other things.\r \r I was only there for a couple of hours. If you like being out away from the city, it might be nice place to stay. For local families it seems like a great weekend retreat for family reunions and conferences."

Apo (highest mountain in the Philippines) so you won't see the mountain when you're in Eden but you'll see it on the way.\r \r The buffet lunch included in the entrance fee (PHP450/person, approx US$10) was ok. Nothing extraordinary. But it was fun to cut the salad leaves yourselves - and the leaves are nice and fresh because they're organically grown at the park itself. There were a lot of people so oftentimes the buffet trays needed to be refilled (and it took some time).\r \r We took the guided shuttle tour within the park (they recommended this for first time visitors) which costs PHP75/person (~US$1.5). You have to choose the time of your tour and each time slot has limited seats. You ride a shuttle around the park (some areas cannot be reached any other way) and the tour guide will describe what you're seeing and a description of the accommodations you can stay in.\r \r Part of the tour are 3 10-15 minute photo stops -- a colorful flower garden, an open air exhibit of the indigenous people who used to live in the area (not sure where they are now?) and a garden of herbs with a really nice hut. The tour guide can help take your picture. The whole tour lasts about 45 minutes to an hour. After the tour there is a shop behind the souvenir shop where you can buy some of the plants (seedlings) to take home. We didn't take any home but they say it takes a few minutes at the airport to get clearance for small plants but about a day for fruit-bearing trees.\r \r We also visited a bird park and enjoyed watching some heron arrange twigs to form a nest :) Other places we saw on the tour but didn't enjoy - swimming pool, area for Filipino games.\r \r All in all, it was a relaxing day."

The tour guide was very accommodating and showed us the beauty of Eden. My kids loved the flower garden and the fishing village. They can't seem to get enough of it. They also enjoyed seeing the deer and the peacock around the fishing village. After we when to the Zipline and the horseback riding. My wife enjoyed the Zipline and of course the kids enjoyed horseback riding :) Next time I would stay overnight to see the fireflies and take a nature hike around the beautiful forest. This is definitely a place to visit in Davao"

Obviously, they are not looking for any business and who would want to go to a place too lazy even to answer the phone?"

		"Review": "Eden Nature Park is a mountain resort 3,000 feet above sea level, it is 95% man-made! It is a great model of how we can re-create nature and rebuild a lost environment. It is a 80 hectares park where you can experience different adventure activities such as Skyrider (The Zipline), a 200-meter long steel cables suspended roughly 20 meters in the air between two steel towers, on which you glide along suspended while enjoying the spectacular view of Davao City and the Davao Gulf. The Mountain Trail for about four-kilometer winding trek through Eden’s forest. They also have Campsites for campers. One good thing about EDEN most of the vegetables they used in their foods can be found on Garden. They are all fresh. Their foods are all great. I enjoy the lunch and adventures here.c:"

		"ReviewTitle": "Just disappointing...",
		"Review": "I've visited Eden before and wasn't too impressed, however they had only been open a short while so I thought I'd give them the benefit of the doubt and hold off from writing a review. This week I'd heard good things from the place and so thought I'd have a return visit. First thing that greeted me was \"we don't have any change\" from the entrance desk. I hear this more and more in Davao thesedays and I think its a scam so that maybe the foreign visitor will say, \"don't worry about it, keep the change\". Maybe I'm wrong but either way thats bad service on the part of the park. I refused to come back later for my change and eventually and unsurprisingly they fould the 40 pesos needed. The entrance fee includes a snack which apparently includes a selection of sandwiches or pasta. This is a blantant lie as the only thing on offer was Pinoy style spagetti which as always has been made so sweet you need to check you have all your teeth afterwards! So quite annoyed by this I thought I'd try the zip line, which after all, looks great. Its wasn't to be as by this time it was 12 noon and all the attractions close for lunch hour! I know this is common practice with many businesses in the Philippines but I never thought a tourist attraction would close for lunch! \r \r The one redeeming feature of the day was the swimming pool which is quite nice and surprisingly not busy considering we visited on a Saturday. However as with all the attractions in the park, you will pay extra for this and then extra still if you want a cottage, and then you have to go through the whole \"no change ordeal again\"! We left the park quite early, very dissappointed and as we drove past the security guard urinating against a tree I vowed never to return to Eden. Its such a shame because the park could be so nice but its let down by bad staff and even worse management. One more thing to add, although its nobody's fault, please be aware that it rains heavily here every day so if your planning a trip, bring an umberella and a change of clothes. If you do decide to visit, I sincerely hope you have a better experience than me!"

		"Review": "Eden Nature Park was a side trip during a visit to Davao City on business. We arrived around lunch time and left by 4:00 p.m. to catch our plane back to Manila. With just about 4 hours to spend at Eden, we decided to do 3 things: \r \r Lunch\r A breezy tour \r The Skyrider (Indiana Jones thing).\r \r Buffet lunch was okay. The selection included Asian dishes, many of them spicy. They also had an array of dessert from cakes to fresh fruit. They also served fresh 100% organic vegetable salad. The restaurant sits on an elevated area overlooking thick vegetation. Peacocks and other farm birds roamed about the dining area, taking food scraps from diners. This could appeal to kids. \r \r The tour about the property was extensive and a little exhausting. We had to take a vehicle designed to take tourists through steep slopes and rugged terrain. We visited a camp site in the middle of the forest, perfect for nature trippers and honeymooners.\r \r Eden Nature Park's flower garden is at one of the area's highest peaks, where one can enjoy a faint Davao cityscape. The area is reminiscent of Tagaytay Highlands, with shades and benches if one wants to stay for a while and see sights.\r \r Eden Nature Park also has a vegetable and fruit farm, where veggies are grown organically. They also advocate aerophonic farming, or growing vegetables without soil. These farms provide fresh ingredients to Eden's restaurants. Families can also fish at the fishponds and kids can enjoy its mini zoo, playground, jogging trail and more.\r \r Now as for the Skyride? There are no words to describe. Try it at once!"

		"Review": "Eden Nature Park is located upland of Davao so it is normally cold specially in the afternoon. It is not accessible to public transportation. We took a habal habal, a motorbike ride which can accommodate 3 passengers only including its driver for an P80.00 two-way ride. But beware of scammers when choosing a habal habal for they are going to charge you a hundred pesos if they know you are a first time tourist. I was glad because ours was recommended by a friend. \r \r Eden Nature Park was just an ordinary \"nature park\" for me. It was a huge park that you should be able to a avail of their tour guide so you can wander around and visit each places riding in a minicab. Entrance fee was quite expensive for me. We availed of their P180.00 entrance fee with a snack, i tell you, nothing special about their snack so don't expect too much about the food. Other rides like Zip line and tour guides are another issue. \r \r What we enjoyed most was the Zip line overlooking Davao Gulf. It was a fantastic view and we had fun riding the zip line for a P150.00 each. The ride was really enjoyable especially for us first timers, geeezzz. I can't forget the excitement riding it.\r \r We also loved their Fishing village, elders took time to catch fishes (carp) in the pond, pay for it and have it cook for them. Nipa huts are scattered around the pond. It was pleasant to see families gathering when one catches fish. \r \r We weren't able to visit other \"must see\" in Eden for I kept on coming back to their Information Desk asking if there were available Tours for us two. They kept on insisting that the cabs were reserved only for tourist, I told them that we were tourist too. But hey, tourist for them are Caucasians and the like...ganun?! geezz....So we left Eden at 3:00pm and i told myself never ever going back there again. One is enough, hehehe"

		"Review": "From the city proper of Davao, we hailed a taxi to take us to Eden Nature Park. He charged PhP600 one way but I tried to haggled\ and he charged us PhP1000 back and forth instead. It was reasonable because we were a group of 5.\r \r It was almost an hour trip from the city via Toril and I recommend that if you want to go there for a day trip, try to go early so that you'll have lots of time to walk along their mountain trail.\r \r The view going there was splendid. I loved it. \r \r Their rates were quite reasonable also. They charged us PhP180 per person for the entrance plus snacks (tuna sandwich or spaghetti and drinks). We didn't avail of the tour because we didn't want to spend more already. Instead, we chose to hike. It was tiresome but it was worth it. I loved the flower garden and the amphitheatre.\r \r This is a definite must-see if you plan in visiting Davao."

		"ReviewTitle": "Don't use the shuttle service!",
		"Review": "We booked a five day stay at Eden, thinking it'd be a restful, nature-trip vacation, where I'd be able to go hiking, catch up a little on work, and the kids would be able to do some fishing and horse back riding. I must say - if you know what to expect - Eden is not that bad. But it's clearly not ready for prime time. For starters, the accomodations are old. The beds creak and the metal supports are rusted. They charge P3350/night, whereas Davao's Marco Polo charges P3,800 per night, yet the quality of accomodations are very far apart. The wifi is very bad! It is down 70% of the time, and is only available from the restaurant (which may be quite a walk from your cottage). The mobile service is even worse - I had to climb a hill to be able to carry a voice conversation, and SMS reception was only possible from our Vista Cottage only 5-10% of the time (the rest of the time, there was No Mobile Service available). So much for being able to catch up on work.\r \r You can get a little hiking done - there is a trail that takes about 1-1.5 hrs to complete, but bear in mind that Eden is a completely walled garden, and you can only hike within the garden. I was under the impression that I could hike towards Mt. Apo then return back down to Eden, but that was not to be. \r \r The fishing was also a disappointment. Eden won't let you catch and release. Everything you catch, you must eat! Our kids went fishing while we slept, and when they returned, we found out that they had caught ten fishes that we had no choice but to consume and eat! Needless to say, a lot of those fishes just went to waste.\r \r It's a lovely setting - but it's a shamethat they try to nickel and dime you. \r \r Most unsettling to me was the shuttle service. First of all, the rates are usurious. An earlier reviewer said the regular cab fare was P400 one way. Eden charged us P1500. On our return trip (from Eden to Davao city), we again paid the P1500 charge. I later found out that Eden doesn't actually own their own shuttle - they subcontract to a company called Far East Car Rental. Thinking that the P1500 rate must be a day rate (or a multihour rate), I asked the shuttle driver if we could also use him in the afternoon, as part of the P1500 service, to pick us up from the Waterfront Hotel and take us to the Marco Polo hotel (a 15 minute ride). To my surprise, when we arrived at the Marco Polo, he charged us an additional P500. When I asked why he had not explained earlier that there was a separate charge, his reply was that he was not working for Far East Car Rental, and that in fact, Far East Car Rental had outsourced the service to Cairo Car Rental (whom he worked for), and it was thus for Far East Car Rental to clarify their rates to us. \r \r So I immediately called up Far East to try to sort things out. If I had only been dealing with Eden, then it would be simple - the hotel would apologize for not apprising me of the additional rates, and given the amount of business I had just given them, they would probably waive the P500 charge. But instead - I had to deal with Far East and Cairo Car Rental passing the buck to each other. Far East said they had texted the rate to the Cairo driver, but the Cairo driver felt it was their responsibility to communicate directly with me. The Cairo car driver then refused to leave the hotel premises until I decided to pay up, saying that P500 would be deducted from his salary, and Far East Car Rental would then tell me that the driver's waiting time at the hotel would be charged to my account! \r \r What a nightmare! I agreed to pay P1500 in the beginning simply because I wanted service, not THIS! In the begining, I wanted to make a point - the P1500 was usurious, but charging P500 (for a 15 minute taxi ride from Waterfront to Marco Polo that normally costs P70) was unthinkable - especially since the driver did not mention that there would be an additional charge. In the end, I just paid up in disgust."

Different people really love nature at a variety of scale. starting from the soft nature lovers to really hardcore nature lovers. For the soft ones, you enjoy the view, ride a small jeep and again enjoy the view with a tour guide then eat at a nice restaurant. The restaurant salad bar is fabulous as they grow their own veggies. For the hardcore nature lovers, you can enjoy short walking trails, go camping maybe do some mountain biking. If you want to just unwind, they also have their nice cottages for rent."

Hopefully next time we will stay at the Eden Garden for at least one night rather than staying at the Marco Polo Davao. The shuttle ride was exceptionally pleasant. We saw all their facilities as well as the many gardens they have for growing their own fruits and vegetables. The guide was also very accommodating and explain clearly the different areas. View of the coastal area was also very nice. We can clearly see the white building of the Marco Polo."

		"Review": "First of all you have to decide what you will do if you go there, and i mean if you are just planing a day visit or to stay overnight in one of their many houses or cabins for rent. If you are just going for a day trip then i recommend going early because getting there and back will not be easy. My wife and I took a taxi from Toril Town to Eden Nature Park. Toril Town is a suburb of Davao and its located at the base of the hill where you get the road to go up to Eden Park. My wife and I paid a driver P400 for the ride up and P300 for the ride back and we also paid him P50 as a tip to stay and wait for us. So the whole taxi ride was only P750 and that way we knew we could get back without a worry. The driver was very nice and he gladly waited for about 3 hours while we were there. Upon arrival you can pay for the lunch and tour combination package, that is what we did. It wont take long to notice how quiet it is compared to the town below or how fresh the air is. Next we at lunch at the buffet style restaurant. Now after being in the country for many days and being very cautious about eating certain foods and drinking the water i did not have any problems there. They informed me that the water is from a spring up high on the hill and not local city water. The vegetables they serve in the restaurant are grown there using the same spring water so it is safe for tourists. Now the food that is served in the restaurant is simple food but it was very tasty and fresh. We both enjoyed it a lot. After lunch we went for a walk around the bird sanctuary and took some photos. Next we went on the tour around the grounds and you ride in a jeep that stops many places for photographs at their very picturesque gardens, and also the people who worked there were all very nice and were willing to take our photograph. So all in all it was a good time. We both enjoyed going there and will go back again on our next trip and next time i will look forward to spending the night to enhance my experience."

The place is really true to its name, Eden a paradise on Earth."

Accomodations were great, clean toilets and or restrooms where stragically located along mountain paths, call of nature indeed! The place was all FUN, be at mountain trailing, bird or deer watching, trill riding, gone fishing, swimming and or horseback riding.\r Nature At its best, i could say. To feel and talk with nature is to commune with GOD. To my Mommy Perla, Big thanks and we love you. Good health,GOD Bless!"
