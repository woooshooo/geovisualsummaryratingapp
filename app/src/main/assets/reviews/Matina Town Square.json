Great bands, great sound, great ambiance. \r Lots of small bars/restaurants around with own designs and entertainment.\r bucket of beer is only P250\r Always crowded. \r You definitely will find something special up to your taste.\r If you using a taxi - better give small bills like P20 to the parking boys to get you a cab fast. Otherwise you will wait long especially on weekends."

The staff were nice and the place had great ac and was very clean. I would go back but next time I would get something else. The halo halo at aling fopings was just ok and you have to pick your toppings just make sure you get them we did not get all of ours. Would I go back may be but not for the halo halo."

It also has coffee shops and drinking places. \r \r I love that people can only smoke at designated areas (which was actually the parking lot). The place is also safe. You can see police officers roaming around the place. Plus Davao observes a very strict curfew and strict rules on drinking. \r \r Come here if you just wanna hang out,eat good food, hear music and laugh around with your friends! :)"

Besides the BBQ stalls, there are nearby fastfood joints like Jollibee and McDonald's. There are also some decent cafes, sweetshops, restaurants, arts and crafts stores, and travel shops around. On particular days they have mini bazaars where you can find bargain items and clothing.\r \r The venue itself is well maintained. The toilets are properly working, the doors and roads are clean and functional. Security is also decent.\r \r Try this place out during the weekend for more interesting sights or weekdays for a more relaxed vibe."

The halo-halo place is popular and you choose what toppings you want on your halo-halo. It is yummy but it seems you pay more for what you get. Still worth to try. There is also an area that usually holds zumba classes which adds to the lively atmosphere. You can also find tour offices, salons and spas on the second floor.
